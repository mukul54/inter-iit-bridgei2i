What with all the billions of spam emails out there, you might think the world has quite enough electronic mail - but now plants are getting in on the action.

Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have used nanotechnology to create spinach plants capable of sending emails when they detect explosives.

In the future, scientists believe, such plants could also offer warnings about pollution or even climate change.

The plants don’t use a mouse and keyboard, of course – instead carbon nanotubes within their leaves emit a fluorescent signal detectable by infrared cameras.

When the cameras detect a change, a simple device sends an email to researchers.

The plants could offer valuable warning signals, the researchers believe.

The plants have been designed so the nanotubes emit a signal when they detect nitroaromatics in water – a compound often found in explosives.

The technology is not unique: it’s part of an emerging field where electronic components work within or with plants, known as ‘plant nanobionics’.

“This is a novel demonstration of how we have overcome the plant/human communication barrier,” said Professor Michael Strano, who led the research.

The research was published in Nature Materials.

Strano said: “Plants are very good analytical chemists. They have an extensive root network in the soil, are constantly sampling groundwater, and have a way to self-power the transport of that water up into the leaves.”

Strano believes that similar systems could be used to offer warnings about pollution, Euronews Living reported.

In an early version of the experiment, Strano and his team used nanoparticles to make plants detect nitric oxide, a pollutant.

Strano said: “Plants are very environmentally responsive. They know that there is going to be a drought long before we do.

Story continues

“They can detect small changes in the properties of soil and water potential. If we tap into those chemical signalling pathways, there is a wealth of information to access.”

The researchers write, “Plant nanobionics aims to embed non-native functions to plants by interfacing them with speciﬁcally designed nanoparticles.

”Living spinach plants (Spinacia oleracea) can be engineered to serve as self-powered pre-concentrators and autosamplers of analytes in ambient groundwater and as infrared communication platforms that can send information to a smartphone.

“These results demonstrate the ability of living, wild-type plants to function as chemical monitors of groundwater and communication devices to external electronics at standoﬀ distances.”

In addition, M80 integrates company’s 5G Ultra safe technologies to save power and make the device more efficient. It is also said that it might remain powered and connected on standby, even when there is no data activity.

MediaTek says that its 5G modem can be used inside smartphones, PCs, Mi-fi hotspots and IoT devices. And the first range of smartphones, featuring a 5G modem are expected to reach the market later in 2021.","MediaTek M80 5G modem brings 7.6Gbps downlink speed, to come in devices later this year",1,en
13,3016,"Motorola has long been a solid bet for budget phones and the Moto G Play (2021) is no exception. For $169.99, you get decent performance, multi-day battery life, and excellent LTE connectivity. Although it ships with Android 10, Motorola promises at least one OS upgrade, which isn’t too common for phones in this price range. If you’re willing to shell out an extra $30, however, the Moto G Power (2021) bests the G Play in almost every way and is a better value overall.

Looks and Feels Good

Though the G Play doesn’t sport the sleek backs and hole-punch displays of its more expensive siblings, it still manages to look good. At 6.6 by 3.0 by 0.4 inches (HWD) and 7.2 ounces, it’s a big phone, but its weight is well distributed and is easy to hold.

The Moto G Play's 6.5-inch LCD is vivid and bright, but clarity could be better.

A 6.5-inch LCD with a teardrop notch for the camera dominates the front of the phone. Display resolution clocks in at 1,600 by 720 pixels, for a density of 269ppi. Both bright and vivid, the display is excellent for video streaming; however, upon close examination, images and text appear soft. For most people, this isn’t a deal-breaker, but if you like to read long articles or e-books on your phone, you may want to look for a sharper display.

Flip the phone over and you’ll find a slightly textured panel with what looks like a matte powder coat finish. It feels warm and pleasant, but it’s a fingerprint magnet. A square camera module sits top center, with the iconic Motorola fingerprint sensor just below it.

On the top of the phone, you’ll find a headphone jack, and on the bottom sit a USB-C charging port and a speaker. A SIM/microSD slot is on the left; a textured power button and volume rocker make their home on the right. The buttons are responsive, easy to identify by feel, and satisfyingly clicky when tapped. That said, they’re positioned toward the top of the phone and people with small hands may have a trouble reaching them.

The durability is what we’d expect for a phone at this price. The plastic back and frame are likely to withstand drops without much damage. Motorola doesn’t list what type of strengthened glass is used for the display, but it seems sturdy and managed to handle a few dings; after several days in backpack filled with all kinds of sharp edges and pointy objects, it was unscratched. Though the G Play lacks an IP rating, it’s water-resistant and should be able to withstand rain or sweat without issue.

Crisp Calls and Decent Data Speeds

Unlocked and AT&T versions of the G Play are available. The unlocked variant works on every US carrier but is missing AT&T bands 14, 29, and 30; however, those are supplemental capacity bands, not primary coverage bands. The AT&T version is locked to its network.

The Moto G Play is among a handful of phones that still has a headphone jack.

The phone’s X11 modem is limited to 2x carrier aggregation, but that doesn't seem to reduce data speeds too much. We tested the G Play on T-Mobile’s network and recorded average speeds of 54.9Mbps down and 18.3Mbps up.

Earpiece volume peaks at 86dB, which is loud enough to hear in almost any atmosphere. Test calls are crisp and clear, and noise cancellation works well.

With a maximum volume of 92dB, the bottom-firing speaker is fine for video calls and social media scrolling, but it sounds tinny. You’ll want to invest in a good pair of headphones—or be thrilled that you can still use your old ones, as this is one of the few 2021 phones with a headphone jack—if you want to stream Spotify on your morning commute.

Multi-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 are supported. NFC and wireless charging are missing, but that’s not uncommon for phones in this price category.

Don’t Throw Out Your DSLR

The G Play has three cameras, none of which is worth writing home about. On the back there's a 13MP sensor with an f/2.0 lens and 2MP depth sensor. On the front, you’ll find a 5MP shooter with an f/2.2 aperture.

Overall image quality is poor. In good light, our test photos had decent depth of field and color accuracy, but we noticed significant loss of clarity in the foreground and background. Low-light test photos were littered with light flares, random splotches, and noise.

Cameras are the Moto G Play's weak spot.

The front-facing camera fares slightly better. Our test photos in good light lacked depth of field, but clarity was better throughout. Low-light photos, on the other hand, were a mess. Our test shots were muddy and filled with noise.

Portrait mode is available on the front and rear cameras. Surprisingly, even with the depth sensor on the rear camera, the selfie cam takes better portraits, at least when you're well-lit.

The rear camera struggles with object mapping. When photographing a single subject, we noticed ears and shoulder blades blurring into the background. In photos with multiple subjects, subjects would blur together around the edges, suggesting the G Play’s AI features struggled with semantic segmentation.

In short, about the best you'll manage with the G Play's cameras are quick selfies of your cute outfits to post on social media.

Surprising Performance for the Price

Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 460 chipset, with 3GB of RAM, powers the G Play. There’s 32GB of storage on board with only 14.5GB available out of the box on the unlocked model. If you buy the AT&T model, expect to find significantly less, since it adds more than two dozen preloaded apps to the equation. Luckily, a microSD slot lets you add storage if you want.

The bottom-firing speaker is loud but harsh

Obviously, this budget phone doesn't had the same lightning-fast performance of more expensive models, but the Snapdragon 460 SoC is surprisingly snappy. It’s an eight-core CPU, with four Cortex A-73 performance cores and four Cortex A-53 efficiency cores, and it has the same Adreno 610 GPU used on the more upscale Snapdragon 665 processor.

If you mostly use your phone to scroll through social media, check emails, and stream content, you’ll likely be happy with the way the G Play performs. There’s a slight lag when opening apps or swiping between screens, but it’s not bothersome.

Gaming performance, on the other hand, is hit or miss. We tested the phone with a few hours of gameplay on Alto’s Odyssey and PUBG Mobile. Load times were slow for both games, but there weren’t any unexpected shutdowns. While playing Alto’s Odyssey, we only noticed a few skipped frames over the course of an hour. On PUBG Mobile, however, we were met with significant lag. Serious smartphone gamers will want to invest in higher-end hardware.

See How We Test PhonesSee How We Test Phones

On Geekbench, a benchmark that quantifies raw computing power, the Moto G Play scored 255 single-core and 1,269 multi-core. For comparison’s sake, the slightly less expensive Moto e earned 228 single-core and 791 multi-core scores.

Motorola claims its 5,000mAh battery offers up to three days of power between charges and we’re inclined to believe them. With moderate daily use, we managed to go for exactly three days before putting the G Play on the charger. In our battery rundown test, which streams HD video over Wi-Fi, the phone held out for 18 hours and 42 minutes before powering down; that’s a big improvement over the Moto e, which eked out just over 10 hours on the same test.

Old Android Strikes Again

The G Play ships with Android 10 and the My UX interface. It’s disappointing that Motorola chose to ship its latest phones with an old version of Android, but at least it committed to an Android 11 upgrade.

Motorola’s phones ship with a near stock version of Android. The My UX skin is minimal and simply offers additional customization options, Moto Gametime, and Moto Actions.

Unless you have big hands, you'll have a hard time reaching the buttons on the Moto G Play.

Moto Gametime is a simple interface that lets you tweak performance and notification settings while gaming. It’s easy to access from the Motorola icon on the home screen. If you’re in the middle of a game, just swipe in from the left side of the screen.

Moto Actions is one of the most intuitive and useful ways to access commonly used apps with simple gestures. If you want to turn the flashlight on, simply make two chopping motions with your wrist. Forgot to turn on Do Not Disturb before a meeting? Just flip the phone face-down and you’re set.

It’s hard to criticize Motorola for a skimpy OS upgrade policy on a phone at this price. That said, we wish Motorola had waited to release the G Play until it could ship with Android 11, or that it would commit to two upgrade cycles.

Hard to Beat for the Price

At $169.99, the Moto G Play is a solid choice for budget shoppers who are willing to make a few compromises. It offers admirable performance, a bright display, and incredible battery life. In return for the savings, however, you’ll have to live with disappointing cameras, and a dated version of Android for the time being. If you’re willing to spend a little more, we think the Moto G Power (2021) is probably a better bet.",Motorola Moto G Play (2021),1,en

Quanta Services (NYSE: PWR), a company that provides outsourcing services to electric utilities as well as the pipeline, industrial and communications industries, has seen its stocks move sideways since we last updated in November, currently trading at levels around $ 70. per share. We think the stock looks like a reasonably good value bet, given that it is trading at around 19 times the expected earnings for 2021, with growth likely to pick up in the coming years.

While the company has a stable revenue base helping electric utilities and oil and gas customers maintain or expand their businesses, there could be a few short-term growth drivers. First, Biden’s presidential administration is expected to invest significantly in renewable energy and energy conservation. Quanta should be able to benefit from this, as it increasingly provides design and development services for wind and solar projects, and is also a leader in smart grid technology. Additionally, there is a growing trend of outsourcing among U.S. utilities, in part due to the aging workforce, which should help Quanta as well. The company could also see favorable winds for the continued rollout of 5G in the United States, as small cells in 5G networks will likely need to use power distribution infrastructure to co-locate antennas atop power poles, calling for services provided by the likes of Quanta. See our analysis on What motivated the Quanta Services stock over the past 3 years? for more details on the evolution of Quanta’s revenues, margins and valuation multiple in recent years.

[11/23/2020]

Quanta Services (NYSE: PWR), a company that provides subcontracting services to electric utilities as well as the pipeline, industrial and communications industries, saw its stock price rise by around 62% year-to-date and has recovered by around 180%. from its March lows, while its electricity business has held up well, despite the Covid-19 pandemic, with recent quarterly results also being stronger than expected. Could the stock trend rise further or is it about to decline? We think Quanta is a reasonably good bet at current levels, for several reasons, which we outline below.

What has motivated Quanta’s performance over the past few years?

Quanta stock has increased by around 125% since the start of 2018. Let’s take a look at Quanta’s performance over the past few years to get a sense of how the company has performed and how. which drove his stock price gains. Revenue grew at an annual rate of approximately 13% between 2017 and 2019, from approximately $ 9.5 billion to approximately $ 12.1 billion, driven by a growing customer base as well as an increase in business from large existing customers as well as through certain acquisitions of both its electric power. the business (which accounts for around 60% of total revenue) and the pipeline and industry segments (around 40% of total revenue). The company’s margins were largely flat at around 3.4% between 2017 and 2019, with net income increasing from around $ 318 million to $ 407 million. EPS grew faster than net income, from around $ 2.02 to $ 2.76 per share between 2017 and 2019, due to share buybacks. Quanta Services

PWR

The P / E multiple has increased from around 19.4x in 2017 to around 24.5x currently, likely due to higher valuations in the market and a preference for companies with relatively lean business models. What motivated the Quanta Services stock over the past 3 years?

What are the prospects for Quanta services?

While sales of Quanta are likely to decline this year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and disruptions associated with the Capex of some customers, particularly in the area of ​​pipeline and industrial infrastructure services which has been affected by a weak energy market, the company is likely to return to growth next year. Several factors could stimulate Quanta’s growth in the medium term. First, the incoming Biden administration is expected to be very positive for renewables, which is likely to boost spending on electricity infrastructure, helping Quanta. Transmission and distribution, in particular, is expected to be a significant area of ​​growth, with North American utility investment expected to increase by about 35% over the next three years 2020 to 2022, compared to the previous three years. [1] Additionally, there has been a growing trend of outsourcing among U.S. utilities, in part due to the aging workforce, which should help the company as well.

We believe that the Quanta share remains a good bet at current levels, given its growth potential, its good visibility on revenues (given the multi-year Capex plans for utilities) and its relatively light business model. The company is currently trading at around 25x 2019 earnings, well below the S&P 500 which is trading at around 36x, and the larger utilities sector which is trading at around 24x trailing earnings, despite slower growth. and more capital intensive.

The Johannesburg-based company will seek to attract the interest of specialist tour companies operating on the continent, they said.

MTN has not made a final decision on the scope or timing of the sale, the people said. Shares slashed early gains to trade 0.7% higher at 3:54 p.m. in Johannesburg and are down 23% over the 12-month period.

MTN, Citi and Standard Bank declined to comment.

The sale of part of the South African portfolio of 13,000 MTN towers would support the company’s plans to raise R25 billion through asset divestments over the next three to five years.

The carrier divested stakes in tower assets in Ghana and Uganda as part of an earlier sales campaign and last year divested a minority stake in e-commerce group Jumia Technologies AG.

Tower companies such as IHS Holding Ltd and American Tower Corp have grown in Africa to meet the growing demand for broadband and adopt smartphones.

21,3032,"It seems that Samsung wants to give a reinvention to its next smartphones in its mid-range Galaxy A, with the recent concepts of the Galaxy A02, or the most recent patent of a new system of rotating pop-up cameras, which would allow to create a front totally occupied by the screen, without sacrificing the presence of a front camera.

The leaked patent describes a phone equipped with a single set of cameras consisting of three sensorss, arranged in a single vertical column at the rear, with the only difference being located very close to the left edge, and touching the top of the terminal.

And is that the trick of this camera is that it will have a small pop-up mechanism that will make your first sensor pop outside the body of the phone. Thus, internally rotating the sensors so that they look in the opposite direction, the same main lens would also become the front camera.

Just like explained in the document, this system is based on a small motor, two gears and a propeller shaft to allow rotation and exit of the pop-up mechanism; in addition to a mobile frame, with a flexible printed circuit board inside that will move together when the camera system is extended.

Thus, to the designs compiled by LetsGoDigital, they also add the first renderings of Concept Creator (shown on the cover), which help us create a more elaborate idea of ​​what this finished terminal might look like.

In addition, despite the addition of the additional framework, other unavoidable disadvantages will remain. low resistance to dust and water.

22,3033,"Image Source : QUALCOMM 35% of smartphones sold in H1 2020 had chipset security: Report

Nearly 35 per cent smartphones sold globally in the first half of 2020 had hardware security embedded in them, a new report has said. Apple led the secure chipset market in H1 2020 with 39 per cent share.

According to latest research from Counterpoint's Component Practice, this share is expected to reach 38 per cent in 2021. Hardware-backed security (strong box) means that keys are stored in the secure element, which is a separate microchip.

""A trusted execution environment (TEE) is a secure area of the main processor which runs its OS and communicates with the main OS via a restricted interface. The strong box approach is more secure,"" explained Research Vice President Neil Shah.

""Apple's portfolio for 2020 has an embedded secure element in the A Series chipsets,"" he added. Smartphones have become vulnerable to attacks. We use them for banking, financial transactions, biometrics, user data and even as digital keys for smart homes and automobiles.

""Therefore, the need for hardware security in smartphones is stronger than ever,"" said Research Analyst Parv Sharma. ""Hardware security is being adopted not only in the premium segment smartphones but has trickled down to the mid-segment as well,"" he added.

The sales of secure smartphones declined 6 per cent in H1 2020 compared to H1 2019. ""The decline is due to the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, which led to reduced overall smartphone sales in H1 2020,"" Sharma noted.

Huawei has also implemented an integrated secure element (inSE) in its SoCs. ""But its share will decline due to US restrictions. Qualcomm has adopted a secure element as a secure processing unit (SPU) in the Snapdragon 800 Series,"" Shah said.

Qualcomm has also trickled down to the Snapdragon 700 Series in the mid-end segment. ""Samsung implements a physically unclonable function (PUF) which serves as a unique identifier. Samsung has also used a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) in the Galaxy A Quantum to make the device more secure,"" Shah explained.",35% of smartphones sold in H1 2020 had chipset security: Report,1,en

NEW DELHI: Union Budgets have a big impact on the economy. But, budget provisions can also impact your immediate and long term spending, investing and saving goals.In this article, timesofindia.com and its knowledge partner Grant Thornton Bharat decode the fineprint of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s budget 2021 to help you understand how your goal of purchasing household consumer durables such as air conditioner (AC), refrigerator or gadgets such as laptops and smartphones are likely to be impacted.If that laptop, AC & refrigerator of yours is showing signs of age, and you were planning to buy a new one, then don't delay anymore. The budget 2021 has made these work and home necessity items more expensive.Union Budget 2021-22: Complete coverageIn line with its 'Made in India' theme, the government has proposed an increase in import duty from the current 10% to 15% on the moulded plastics used for making chargers and adapters in the laptops.Also, the government has proposed an increase of customs duty from 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent on compressors used in ACs and refrigerators.As such, the electronic goods makers who are importing these components are likely to face higher cost of production in the coming days, and the resulting cost is likely to be passed on to the end consumer.If you are planning to buy a smartphone in the new financial year, then the same is likely to become more expensive, especially from the companies who assemble them in India, and the components are imported, not 'Made in India'.In line with the government’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative, the finance minister has proposed hike in customs duty on critical components of mobile phones including parts for manufacturing printed circuit board assembly, camera modules, moulded plastic for chargers/adaptors etc.The hike in duty ranges from 2.5% to 10% for different products, majority of which is effective April 1, 2021. The measures also seek to withdraw exemptions on parts of charger and sub-parts of mobile phones that are imported. This will effectively increase the cost of imports and subsequently the smartphones across the range, as the margins are limited in the industry.On the flip side, the enhanced duty measures would encourage international players specialising in the manufacturing of smartphones and their components, to set up a base in India. This would create more employment opportunities locally.","How budget 2021 impacted your goal of buying smartphone, laptop & consumer durables",1,en

According to a new study from NordVPN, applications used to monitor device activity were installed on 549k devices across the US last year. While alarming, this number is actually one percent lower when compared to the previous year.

Monitoring apps also saw increased usage on a global scale and last year, five percent more of these apps were installed on users' devices, affecting approximately 1,132.262 people across the world.

We've built a list of the best business VPN services available

These are the best proxy service providers on the market

Also check out our roundup of the best anonymous browsers

Digital privacy expert at NordVPN, Daniel Markuson explained in a press release how parental control apps built for parents to keep tabs on their children online can be abused to track others, saying:

“Applications like KidsGuard, mSpy, Spy Phone, and Highster are primarily built for parents to monitor activity on their kids’ phones. It allows parents to keep an eye on the communications their minors are having online. Sadly, installed without the owner’s consent, such tools can turn into very powerful spyware to read messages, record screen activity, track GPS locations, and use cameras to see what an individual is doing.”

Growing suspicious

Users concerned that they are being monitored online can easily check if they have monitoring apps installed on their devices by using stalkerware detectors such as AntiSpy & Spyware Scanner and Anti Spy.

NordVPN's research found that 37 percent of Americans downloaded apps to help detect spyware on their mobile devices when compared to the previous year. This reaction was shared by users worldwide as 16 percent more spyware detection tools were downloaded in 2020.

“The use of stalkerware steals the victim’s physical and online freedom. Once the perpetrator knows what it is you were interested in and what secrets you shared with the people you trust, they can gain full control of your life and turn it against you”, Markuson added.

To protect against stalkerware and unwanted online tracking, Markuson recommends that users secure their devices with a password or biometrics and use a VPN service at all times. Additionally, users should go through the apps on their devices and ensure location tracking is turned off.",Thousands more American were monitored through their devices last year,1,en

The US smartphone market saw a six per cent year-on-year decline in sales in Q4 2020, despite a record high iPhone sales, as Covid-19 continued to impact the economy, said a new report.

Apple and Samsung were the only original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to see positive growth in the quarter, thanks to new launches and a strong demand for premium devices during the holiday season, industry tracker Counterpoint Research said on Monday.

""Q4 2020 was a particularly challenging quarter for many OEMs, especially those who manufacture devices for the prepaid and lower price band markets,"" Jeff Fieldhack, US Mobile Devices and Carrier Strategies Director at Counterpoint, said in a statement.

""With COVID-19 still showing record number of US cases, there were over 10.7 million unemployed people at the end of 2020. The economic effect of this can be seen in the negative growth of many OEMs in the quarter,"" Fieldhack said.

Apple grew 14 per cent year-on-year in Q4 despite a delayed iPhone 12 launch while Samsung gained five per cent year-on-year.

""Given this strong demand for new iPhones and supply shortages in Q4 2020, we expect sales to spill over into Q1 2021,"" Research Analyst Maurice Klaehne added.

Samsung had a strong quarter as well, mainly due to the success of the Samsung S20 FE 5G, according to Senior Research Analyst Hanish Bhatia. ""The OEM even launched a 256GB variant in the quarter to meet further demand from customers looking to buy a sub-$1,000 device,"" Bhatia said.

29,3041,"Samsung has a new smartphone to offer first-time phone buyers in India – the Galaxy M02. This comes across as an entry-level phone with extremely basic specs and features but still makes for a decent package considering that it will sell for just Rs. 6,999. The Galaxy M02 will be replacing the M01 and is the second smartphone in Samsung’s M0 series.

Samsung Galaxy M02 detailed specs:

The M02 offers a 6.5-inch HD+ LCD display with a waterdrop notch at the top. Bezels are a bit on the thicker side all around going by today’s standards, more so for the bottom edge where there is quite a bit of it. The phone otherwise measures 9.6 mm and has a bit of heft as well, tipping the scales at 206 grams.

Under the hood, there is the MediaTek processor though Samsung is yet to specifically mention the processor type. Nonetheless, the phone comes with two memory size options – 2 GB and 3 GB though for either models, there is 32 GB of native storage available. Should you need more storage, you can do so via a microSD card.

On the rear, you will find a dual-lens camera arrangement comprising of a 13 MP primary camera and a 2 MP macro shooter. For selfies, there is a 5 MP camera on the front. The phone runs Android 10 right out of the box, with the company’s One UI running on top. For power, there is the rather beefy 5000 mAh battery that should keep things running for more than a day comfortably.

For connectivity, the M02 boasts of Bluetooth 4.2, 4G LTE, and Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/. There is the 3.5 mm headphone jack as well, as is a micro USB 2.0 port.

Price and availability:

The Galaxy M02 range starts at Rs. 6,999 and comes in shades of Black, Grey, and Red. The company is, however offering an introductory price of Rs. 6,799 for a limited time.

32,3046,"Despite the government’s assurances, Indian smartphone makers are very much likely to be hit by the hike in basic customs duty (BCD) on import of mobile phone sub-parts.

The Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in the National Budget 2021-22, announced increase in duty on chargers from 15 per cent to 20 per cent, motherboard from 10 per cent to 20 per cent and in similar range for other components used in manufacturing of mobile phones.









Industry experts said the levy of duty will add cost pressure on brands competing in the sub-Rs10,000 category, but market leaders such as Xiaomi will be able to absorb the cost, which can be offset with the kind of volumes they sell. The government has proposed that with effect from April 1, BCD on import of printed circuit board assembly (PCBA), camera modules and connectors should be raised to 2.5 per cent. For PCBA, and moulded plastic for manufacture of charger or adapter, duty should go up from the existing 10 per cent to 15 per cent. Whereas, other inputs and parts of chargers will attract 10 per cent duty, from nil earlier.

Bibhash Deb, head taxation, legal & secretarial at Lava International, told ET that featurephones and entry-level smartphones will be worst impacted where it is difficult to manage the bill of materials. “This will adversely affect a brand like Lava. We are already battling the blow of 10 per cent hike in duty on display assembly, which came in October 2020 amid severe global component shortage,” Deb said. But he also pointed out that the budgetary allocation of Rs 50,000 crore in strengthening local R&D on priority sectors will aid Indian makers like Lava to take on global competition.

Industry experts said the hike in import duty will not affect consumers in India much because 97 per cent of mobile market requirements is being met through domestic production.

37,3054,"Apple and Samsung were the only original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to see positive growth in the quarter, thanks to new launches and a strong demand for premium devices during the holiday season, industry tracker Counterpoint Research said on Monday.

San Francisco, Feb 2 (IANS) The US smartphone market saw a six per cent year-on-year decline in sales in Q4 2020, despite a record high iPhone sales, as Covid-19 continued to impact the economy, said a new report.

""Q4 2020 was a particularly challenging quarter for many OEMs, especially those who manufacture devices for the prepaid and lower price band markets,"" Jeff Fieldhack, US Mobile Devices and Carrier Strategies Director at Counterpoint, said in a statement.

""With COVID-19 still showing record number of US cases, there were over 10.7 million unemployed people at the end of 2020. The economic effect of this can be seen in the negative growth of many OEMs in the quarter,"" Fieldhack said.

Apple grew 14 per cent year-on-year in Q4 despite a delayed iPhone 12 launch while Samsung gained five per cent year-on-year.

""Given this strong demand for new iPhones and supply shortages in Q4 2020, we expect sales to spill over into Q1 2021,"" Research Analyst Maurice Klaehne added.

Samsung had a strong quarter as well, mainly due to the success of the Samsung S20 FE 5G, according to Senior Research Analyst Hanish Bhatia.

""The OEM even launched a 256GB variant in the quarter to meet further demand from customers looking to buy a sub-$1,000 device,"" Bhatia said.

""However, January and February tend to be a lull in the market, and with Apple's current momentum, there will be less opportunities for Samsung to capitalise on.""

Mahindra XUV300 petrol-AMT details

Starting with the new engine-gearbox configuration, the XUV300’s 110hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine is now available with the option of a 6-speed AMT gearbox. As with the diesel-AMT variants, the AMT gearbox option is available with the mid-spec W6 and the fully-loaded W8(O) trim levels.

As with the diesel AMTs, the W6 AMT variant additionally comes with ESC and hill-start assist, features that are not available on its manual counterpart. The 6-speed gearbox also comes equipped with a creep function, which, interestingly, is automatically disabled should one of the SUV’s doors open.

The W8(O) AMT gets all the bells and whistles including auto headlamps, dual-zone climate control, keyless entry and go, a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, satellite navigation, 7 airbags, ESC, hill-start assist, a rear view camera and front parking sensors, to name a few. A new addition, though, to the W8(O) AMT – petrol and diesel – is Mahindra’s BlueSense Plus connected car technology with over 40 connected car features.

Mahindra BlueSense Plus

Mahindra’s BlueSense Plus systems are divided into five broad categories – remote vehicle controls, location-based functions, safety and security, vehicle alerts and miscellaneous functions.

Under remote vehicle operations, owners can lock/unlock the cars via their smartphone, switch on the air-con, activate the hazard lights and more. The location-based functions include live vehicle tracking, location sharing and sending the owner alerts in case the car deviates from a set route.

Safety and security functions include alerts in case the vehicle is being stolen, geo-fencing and time fencing-based alerts, low tyre pressure, overspeeding and not wearing a seat belt. Additionally buyers can also get details such as fuel levels, tyre pressure, odometer reading and more, on their phones.

Another important update is the introduction of a sunroof on the lower variants. Previously only available on the fully-loaded W8(O), it is now available on the mid-spec W6 and W8 variants – manual and AMT – as well. However, the new addition does increase prices, with the W6 variant now priced from Rs 9.4 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai) – about Rs 27,000 more.

The EcoSport has the highest starting price for a petrol-auto given that it’s only available in one fully-loaded variant.

Highlights Spinach leaves are enriched with nutrition and good health

According to a viral tweet, they can be used to sense soil around them

This information can then be conveyed to scientists via email

Spinach is one of the healthiest vegetables which can be added to the daily diet. A versatile ingredient, the leafy green is enriched with vitamins A, C, K as well as minerals such as Iron, Manganese and Magnesium. Among the multiple health benefits, Spinach is best known to strengthen bones and maintain good eyesight and immunity. However, according to recent reports, scientists have found an all-new function of the humble vegetable. Believe it or not, scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Techonlogy (MIT) have transformed spinach leaves into sensors capable of detecting information and relaying it back to the scientists via email. Take a look:





As per an in-depth study on Nature Materials, scientists have used a field of technological research called 'Plant Nanobionics' to achieve this extraordinary feat. ""Here, we demonstrate that living spinach plants can be engineered to serve as self-powered pre-concentrators and autosamplers of analytes in ambient groundwater and as infrared communication platforms that can send information to a smartphone,"" reads the paper. Thus, spinach leaves are now being converted into sensors, which can detect the presence of compounds in the soil. When they are detected, an infrared camera picks up the signal and sends an email alert to scientists. Spinach could, therefore, be used to warn the researchers about factors such as pollution, climate change and even explosives like land mines etc.

The tweet about the news was shared by @euronewsliving and it soon went viral on social media. Several users reacted to the bizarre yet interesting development in the world of science. Take a look at some of the hilarious reactions by Twitterati:

Both these handsets have been in the news from the last couple of weeks, thanks to the emerging renders, benchmarks, and certification listing. A few days ago, the Galaxy A52 5G’s variant with model number SM-A5260 was certified by TENAA and 3C authority. At that time, the TENAA listing did not reveal any specs of the device, nor any images. Well, this time the listing is updated, which reveals some renders of the Galaxy A52 along with few key specifications.

If we go by the images revealed by China’s TENAA certification, they do match with the one that popular leakster Evan Blass had leaked through Voice post.

The device will measure around 159.9 x 75.1 x 8.4mm in terms of dimensions. On the software side, the A52 will boot Android-11 based One UI 3.0. Under the hood, the smartphone is supposed to pack in Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 750G SoC. It might be available in either 6GB/8GB RAM option along with 128/256GB internal storage.

As seen in the images above, the Galaxy A52 will feature a quad-camera setup at the rear, which might house in a primary 64-megapixel sensor. Front-facing camera details of the device remain under wrap for the time being. As per the TENAA listing, the Galaxy A52 5G might be available in Awesome Black, Awesome White, Awesome Violet, and Awesome Blue colours. The whole package might be fueled by a 4500mAh battery with support for 15W fast charging (9VDC, 1.67A).

Along with the A52 5G, Samsung will also be launching a 4G model, which is said to feature the same specs, offering Snapdragon 720G SoC, and 8GB of RAM. Earlier leaked details hints that the Galaxy A52 4G variant with 128GB storage might retail for EUR 369. As far as pricing of the 5G model with 256GB storage goes, it might start for around EUR 429. As of now, Samsung is yet to announce the launch date of both the Galaxy A52 and the Galaxy A72. However, considering the array of leak emerging out every day, the launch of both the handsets doesn’t seem to be that far away.

Other companies, such as Vernier Software and Technology, offer thermocouple temperature sensors to measure temperatures in the range of –200oC to 1400oC. It can also be used to measure flame temperatures as high as 1400 ?C, or liquid nitrogen temperatures at -196 ?C.

- Moreover, the region is expected to supply much of the world’s growing demand for oil over the next five years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). As per the IEA, the United States is expected to account for 80% of the global oil supply increase between 2017 and 2025, as shale producers find more ways to pump oil profitably at lower prices. Thus, the growing oil and gas sector in the country is likely to boost further the demand for the market studied over the forecast period.

- With the U.S. Department of the Interior planning to allow offshore exploratory drilling in about 90% of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) acreage, under the National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program (National OCS Program) for 2019-2024, the oil and gas sector in the region is expected to open up new opportunities to the market.

- Additionally, the healthcare industry uses temperature sensors extensively for continuous cardiac output monitoring, thermal dilution catheters, etc. With such advancements across various industries in the region and the R & D of various types of temperature sensors being integrated into more and more products, the market for temperature sensors is set to grow at a healthy rate.



Competitive Landscape

The competitive rivalry is high in this market, owing to the presence of many players operating in the market, such as Honeywell, Texas Instruments, and STMicroelectronics among other regional and local manufacturers. Continuous product upgradation and industry convergence are driving the market towards highly differentiated offerings. Some of the key developments in the area are:

- Feb 2020 - Texas Instruments expanded its temperature sensing portfolio to include linear thermistors that deliver up to 50% higher accuracy than negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors. The higher accuracy of TI’s thermistors can enable operation closer to the other components’ thermal limits and the overall system. It can help engineers maximize performance while reducing bill-of-materials (BOM) and total solution cost.

The global wireless speaker market size by revenue is expected to pose an absolute growth of 150% during the forecast period. The market is likely to witness an increase in revenue during the period 2021-2026. However, Arizton believes that YOY growth will slow down continuously afterward. The major reasons are the increased penetration of smart speakers across the globe and a short repurchase cycle, leading to technological disruptions. In 2021?2024, in terms of unit shipments, the YOY growth of wireless speakers will be in the double-digit due to the high demand for smart devices from Europe, North America, and APAC, coupled with the rise in awareness of wireless audio devices in developing countries. The increasing demand from developed markets, the integration of voice-assistance technology in household appliances, and enhanced marketing and visibility of smart products online are other major factors contributing to the growth of the market.



The following factors are likely to contribute to the growth of the wireless speaker market during the forecast period:

• The popularity of Voice-First Technology

• Rise in IoT Investment

• Increased Influence of Internet on Purchasing Behavior

• Growth in Online Music Streaming Services



The study considers the present scenario of the wireless speaker market and its market dynamics for the period 2020?2026. It covers a detailed overview of several market growth enablers, restraints, and trends. The report offers both the demand and supply aspects of the market. It profiles and examines leading companies and other prominent ones operating in the market.



Global Wireless Speaker Market Segmentation

The global wireless speaker market research report includes a detailed segmentation by connectivity type, price range, distribution channel, end-user, product type, geography. Based on connectivity, the global wireless speaker market is categorized into Bluetooth and wireless. While Bluetooth speakers are getting laced with new features, the inclusion of rugged and waterproof features is expected to drive the demand for these devices during the forecast period. In addition, increased battery life, 360-degree surround sound, customizable led lights, app sync feature, and smart assistant are likely to make the product attractive to a wide variety of audience, thereby influence the market growth. Traditional speakers are attaining maturity in developed countries on account of lack of innovation and feature enchantment. However, waterproof Bluetooth speakers are gaining traction in the US and Western European countries. Rugged speakers have gained immense popularity among end-users worldwide as they are shockproof, dirtproof, and waterproof.



In 2020, the low-end segment by unit shipment dominated the market with a share of over 49% share. However, as these devices are priced at a low price in the market, the overall revenue generation is less despite high unit shipment. These devices are portable and offer excellent sound quality. The low price of these models is expected to attract more consumers from the residential segment since these models offer ease and convenience.



In 2020, standard speakers dominated the market with a share of over 44%. Concentrated demand from APAC and Latin America has been a major factor for market growth. The APAC region is expected to generate incremental revenue of approx. $4 billion during the forecast period. Moreover, easy accessibility, affordability, and the presence of several domestic vendors are expected to influence the market. However, the growing popularity of smart speakers has cannibalized the market share of standard sound devices.



Wireless speakers are experiencing high application in the residential segment. These devices are used for music streaming via smartphones or other hand-held devices at home. Multi-room types are gaining popularity and boosting the market growth. With a high number of consumers recognizing the benefits of hybrid devices, including portability, power-saving options, easy installation, and high sound quality, they are gaining prominence in the residential segment.



Over 375 million units of wireless speakers are expected to be sold by 2026 via offline distribution channels, which include specialty stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets, and electronic stores. The entry of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth speaker manufacturers in the traditional market has increased the sale of smart speakers through retail stores worldwide. Online distribution channels are likely to account for approx. $38 billion by 2026. Compared to retail stores, online stores offer a variety of options to choose from, which is one of the major factors contributing to the growth. Online retailers offer devices at discounted prices rather than list prices that could apply to electronic stores and other brick-and-mortar distribution channels. However, the online segment could face strong competition from the retail segment in the future due to the expected entry of traditional speaker manufacturers and other electronic device vendors in the market.

Original story (published on November 18, 2020) follows:

Apple’s latest and greatest version of its mobile operating system known as iOS 14 was announced on June 2020, and subsequently released on September 16.

iOS 14 is arguably one of the biggest updates offered by Cupertino perhaps since iOS 11 for its iPhone series.

The operating system comes with a plethora of new features like widget support, App Library, Compact UI, search improvements and much more.

Moreover, Apple has yet again proven its reliability and continued software support by releasing the update for all the devices that previously got the iOS 13 update – all the way back to the iPhone 6s series.

Other devices that received the update are: iPhone SE, iPhone 7 series, iPhone 8 series, iPhone X and XR, iPhone XS series, and the iPhone 11 series.

And yeah, the iPhone 12 series comes with iOS 14 out of the box, of course.

One unsurprising thing though, about not just iOS, but software in general, is the presence of unwanted guests. After every major update, the number of reports pertaining to all sorts of bugs see a huge spike.

The iOS 14 update is no different, and although Apple does offer a pretty systematic beta program to filter out potential bugs and issues, a few always end up reaching the stable releases.

These bugs/issues/problems usually get acknowledged almost immediately by Apple, while others stay on for a while.

With that being said, we keep track of such developments and provide crucial information about their status as soon as there are any updates, in this article.

1) iPad 2019 7th Gen (running ios 14.4) facetime calling an iPad Air (running ios 12.5.1). 2 HOUR call maintained connection with no drop out!

60,3084,"Xiaomi recently announced the brand new Mi Air Charge Technology. It’s a wireless charging mechanism that can charge devices like smartphones and tablets from a distance. Xiaomi claims this distance to be a radius of several meters. Moreover, More than one device can be charged at 5W simultaneously. According to Xiaomi, the charging efficiency shall not be influenced or blocked by physical obstacles like furniture or a wall.

“We’re excited to bring you the remote charging technology – Mi Air Charge Technology! Charge multiple devices simultaneously while you’re gaming, walking around, or even when something’s in the way, no strings attached. Another giant leap forward in wireless charging technology!” – Xiaomi

- Advertisement -

Xiaomi’s Air Charge Technology works across different gadgets like smartwatches and fitness bracelets equally well. Xiaomi aims to is to make “living rooms truly wireless,” with speakers, lamps, and smart home devices all working by a single remote system.

How does the Mi Air Charge Technology work?

The main technology that works behind Xiaomi’s remote charging works on space positioning and energy transmission. Xiaomi has developed an isolated charging pile that has five phase interference antennas. These antennas can detect the location of the device like a smartwatch or a smartphone with high accuracy. It also has a phase control assembly consisting of 144 antennas transmitting waves straight to the connected device.

“Xiaomi’s patented Mi Air Charge Technology makes use of a special self-developed tower/box-like device that uses beamforming technology to send millimetre waves directly to a device. These waves are converted to electric power that charges the device.” – Xiaomi

Xiaomi has said that Mi Air Charge technology is merely a tech demo at this stage. Thus, it’s still ambiguous if the company will overcome the implementational and structural market dilemmas faced by other companies that have exhibited remote charging models.

There are also health concerns, and there’s no doubt that if this technology ever makes it to market, it’ll be heavily scrutinized by regulatory authorities.

“This new wireless charging technology can charge devices at a speed of 5W, even in the presence of physical obstacles that don’t reduce charging efficiency. It comes with a phase control array composes of 144 antennas, which emits millimetre waves through beam-forming, creating electric energy via a rectifier circuit.” – Xiaomi

What are the issues and concerns related to air charging?

Health Concerns: There is no doubt that the telecommunications industry and its manufacturers have been accused several times of the health concerns posed by electronic gadgets and electromagnetic radiations. Xiaomi’s Air charging technology utilizes electromagnetic radiations in the transparent medium unless it’s converted to electrical signals at the transmitter and the receiver circuits. Thus, it’s apparent that it shall pose similar health concerns as any other device. With the integration of 5G technology, the overall radiation may become strong enough to start interfering with the physiological functioning of human and animal cells. Energy concerns: Charging using a USB cable is one of the most efficient methods of charging as the electrical energy is transferred directly from the adapter to the electronic device like a Charging using a USB cable is one of the most efficient methods of charging as the electrical energy is transferred directly from the adapter to the electronic device like a smartphone or a smartwatch. There is hardly any dissipation of electrical energy in the USB cable. Contrary to this, air charging is not based on the principle of directional charging. Rather, the electromagnetic energy is emitted in the entire space in a radius of a few meters. This can raise energy concerns in the future if not optimized.

If Xiaomi succeeds in optimising the air charging technology, this technology can prove to be a game-changer for smart devices, especially when integrated with AI, IoT, and 5G. In the recent past, many companies have tried to invent remote charging systems, so it’ll be fascinating to see if Xiaomi will be the first to manufacture it.

65,3092,"Colour. It’s the way the world is seen. In colour, memories are made and remembered. Rooted in human experience and history, the world has always been a rich spectrum. Adventurers and explorers have celebrated its vibrant wonders for thousands of years, and colour is why OPPO is always pushing the boundaries of smartphone display development.

The team at OPPO won’t rest until you can hold the richest, most colourful experiences the world has to offer, in all their glory, in the palm of your hand.

OPPO Find X2 paves the way for Find X3 and its display excellence

OPPO Find X2 was the first smartphone to deliver both crisp QHD+ resolution and a silky smooth 120Hz refresh rate simultaneously, with pro-level colour accuracy. Almost a year on, its legacy shines brightly.



Uncovering the ultimate in everything it displays, OPPO Find X2 brings visuals to life. When capturing a fascinating image, delighting in the glow of ColorOS, or immersing yourself in vivid, rich HDR video, OPPO’s Ultra Vision screen is clear, smooth, accurate and comfortable.

Perfectly proportioned, at 6.7-inches, Find X2’s curved screen takes immersion to another dimension. Slender bezels frame the action, while a slight but mighty front camera is hidden within. Meanwhile, fluid curves add the high-end, in-hand feel you’d expect from a luxury accessory.

A true benchmark, while the industry stuck with 60Hz and 90Hz screens in 2020, Find X2 led the pack with an ultra-high 120Hz refresh rate. The result: games that play faster, social feeds that effortlessly glide, and an interface that feels like an extension of your fingertips.

Of course, everything needs to look crisp too, and a 1440 x 3168 resolution makes sure Find X2 delivers a crystal clear, 513 PPI pixel density. Supporting 100 per cent of the DCI-P3 colour gamut, Find X2 showcases smooth, seamless gradients. Combined with HDR10+ support and a 5000000:1 contrast ratio, exquisite detail and dynamic range come together to create blacks that look inky and endless, colours that leap out and picture clarity that takes your breath away.

World-class specs are only part of a smartphone screen’s story. Find X2 represents OPPO’s, and the industry’s first endeavour into bringing a new, advanced viewing experience to consumers. Introducing one of the first 10-bit, or 1 billion colour mobile displays, it showcases world-class hardware and software engineering. Along with pro-level colour accuracy, this 2020 OPPO flagship became the benchmark for colour reproduction going into 2021, receiving critical acclaim from professional designers and photographers alike.

A billion colours from end-to-end

With Find X2’s class-leading display and imaging technology, OPPO created a perfect prelude to something incredible. After all, OPPO is constantly innovating and pushing the boundaries of technology. When you think your experience can’t get any better, OPPO will Find a way.



This brings us to the first 10-bit Full-path Colour Management System, unveiled by OPPO at INNO Day 2020. It’s the next step in imaging excellence and a true billion colour display experience.

OPPO’s Full-path billion colour system is the first in an Android phone to support the full DCI-P3 wide colour gamut and 10-bit colour from capture to storage to display, for end-to-end viewing enjoyment.

This has been made possible by improving the underlying hardware responsible for colour reproduction, as well as upgrading OPPO’s imaging algorithms.

Professional, digital film-grade colour accuracy can also be achieved thanks to OPPO’s screen calibration, while OPPO’s proprietary algorithm guarantees colour gamut compatibility, supporting the 100 per cent DCI-P3 in 10-bit colour.

Compared to a depth of 8-bits, 10-bit colour reduces the artificial visual elements generated by gaps in colour and improves tonal graduation, enhancing the quality of images during creation and display.

It’s also worth taking a moment to reflect on a new standard in image format excellence. With a size of around 50 per cent that of a JPEG, the new HEIF format forms part of OPPO’s end-to-end experience, fully supporting 10-bit image storage.

Our smartphone screens are like windows. Through them, we explore the ever-changing fabric of our beautifully complex, digital lives. Their importance isn’t just digital, though; it’s human too. We look at our loved ones on them, capture our lives through them, and escape with them as we watch, play and recharge our own batteries. It’s this human need that drives OPPO in its relentless pursuit of display excellence.",The Billion Colour Journey Continues,1,en

Education, today, is considered a democratic right. Delivering quality education is also one of 17 global goals that make up the ”2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”. So, how does India fare in this regard? Today, 260 million students study in 1.3 million schools in the country. The literacy rate of the country has grown significantly in the last 30 years, from 39% in 1991 to 69.1% in 2018, according to an Educational Statistics report released by MHRD. Yet, according to an ASER report from 2019, when 30,000 students who had completed at least eight years of education were tested, about 25% of them were unable to read basic text fluently in any language including their mother tongue. Over half this number struggled with simple division problems. So, how effective is our education system? Are just a meagre percentage of students able to acquire a quality of education that truly equips them with the tools to succeed at work and life?

Weeding Out Rote Learning

The existing system’s idea of education, in a traditional sense, is that of teachers delivering lectures to classrooms with a very high teacher-student ratio. Children simply do not get the kind of personalised attention they need. In turn, millions of children turn to the rote-mode, out of mere desperation to pass on to the next grade. They end up with a poor grasp of the fundamentals, and are ill-prepared, both in terms of knowledge and skills, for the world of work. They are unable to compete and rise up to the demands of the workplace. Technology-enabled education solves many of the problems incurred in the traditional classroom mode, especially in a country as diverse and highly populated as India.

Leveraging Tech To Scale Quality Education

Today, almost every industry and ecosystem is embracing digital transformation. This is the new normal, and the education sector cannot be left behind. Technology-enabled education or Edtech has the potential to disrupt the status quo in the education sector, and raise the bar on quality and scale. It can also equip students with the technical, interpersonal and digital skills needed to succeed in a digitised economy such as India. This shift that is already demonstrating impact, led to the genesis of DIKSHA, an ambitious project designed to make quality education, a reality for millions of children across the nation.

One Nation, One Digital Platform

On a Sunday in May 2020, DIKSHA was launched by Nirmala Sitharaman, Honorable Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs of India. Under the initiative, 100 universities will offer e-courses to 25 crore K-12 students, and 3.7 crore students pursuing higher education, starting from May 30, 2021. The vision of DIKSHA is to offer “multi-mode” access to education to students of Class 1 to 12, across the nation. The true value of this initiative lies in its flexibility, inclusive design and potential to meet diverse needs.

Reaching Every Student

Today, only 24% of India’s population owns a smartphone, just 15% of the rural population has access to the internet, and the number of DTH subscribers stands at merely 69.3 million. Via DIKSHA, E-content and QR coded textbooks, have been made available in 14 languages, with more in the pipeline. A dedicated channel is available for every class, from 1 to 12, and 32 DTH channels have been identified for those students who do not have access to the Internet. Additionally, audio content is available through 289 radio channels. Yet, despite the multi-mode approach to making education accessible, the key challenge is to be able expand reach and deliver this content to every child.

Making Content More Consumable

Breaking down content into byte-sized nuggets delivered via short, crisp TikTok-style videos, will help make education more engaging for students. Gamification of lessons will add credits to the content available, and enhance the overall experience and learning curve. To address the issue of reach, there’s a need for a massive drive to put more digital devices in the hands of students. Government initiatives like Vidyadaan, are aiding many school students across all states. Additionally, digital devices made available at subsidized prices with the help of CSR funds and programs like “adapt a school”, will be an added boon to students from severely underprivileged backgrounds.

Leaving No Child Behind

According to a UNESCO report from 2019, over 75% of children with disabilities never attend school. Those who do attend, have major difficulties due to the lack of accessibility and inclusiveness of our school system. In this regard, technology has been a game-changer for children with disabilities. DIKSHA makes it even more accessible due the design and delivery of its content. Special e-content has been designed for children with visual and hearing difficulties, and it is made available via the Digitally Accessible Information System (DAISY) and Indian Sign Language on the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) website/ YouTube channel. Special radio podcasts have also been integrated to support students.

Digital Learning For All

Another group of students, often excluded by our education system, are those who learn differently. Our schools, for instance, are ill-equipped to support children with dyslexia. However, technology-enabled education via DIKSHA has the potential to empower dyslexic children to reach their true potential in a way that was always considered unimaginable. Through the use of bright colored video content, mind maps, gamified lessons and other interactive models, learning can become a joy for children with dyslexia and other learning difficulties.

This inclusiveness is the true power of an initiative like DIKSHA, which has the potential to transform the destinies of millions of children, with diverse needs, stories and abilities.","DIKSHA - A Step Towards Making Education For All, A Reality!",1,en

Original story (published on July 10, 2020) follows:

Realme is one of the fastest-growing tech companies in the world right now. With only a couple or so years in business, the company is doing what some big tech companies like LG have often failed to achieve despite years of experience in the smartphone business.

Timely software updates are unheard of on LG’s little smartphone island. But that’s untrue with Realme phones. Perhaps it’s the close ties with OPPO, which has years of experience making smartphones but with a hardly decorated software update history (policy).

Or maybe it’s just sheer dedication from the Realme team to ensure that device owners have the latest software update available. For now, we’ll hang on to the latter course and hope Realme doesn’t become complacent, just like it’s already happening with the Android 11 update.

The company revealed in March 2020 that Realme UI 2.0 development was already underway. Not long after, the Realme 2 Pro was ruled out of contention for the big update, which will also bring Android 11 to multiple devices.

In May 2020, recruitment into Realme UI 2.0 beta officially started. And in June Realme dropped the bomb, confirming that Android 11 beta will be ready for Realme X50 Pro units in July.

True to its word, Realme has released the first beta version of Android 11 for early adopters who own the Realme X50 Pro. But that’s not the only device getting updated to Realme UI 2.0. We have a potential list here.

As for this moment, though, these are the Realme smartphones that have picked up the beta or stable update to Android 11 (Realme UI 2.0).

Press Release -Current testing follows preceding pre-clinical tests indicating efficacy of the novel PARP inhibitor stenoparib against SARS-Cov-2, the virus which is the origin of the B.1.1.7 variant, B.1.351 variant, and other variants. -Allarity Therapeutics is one of the leading companies worldwide developing a potential treatment for SARS-Cov-2 and the B1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. Hørsholm, Denmark (24 February 2021) – Allarity Therapeutics A/S (“Allarity” or the “Company”) today announced an update related to the ongoing pre-clinical testing of the antiviral activity of its PARP inhibitor, stenoparib, against Coronavirus Variant B.1.1.7 (“British variant”) and Variant B.1.351 (“South African variant”). The tests are being conducted by the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute at Northern Arizona University (NAU), a leading U.S. infectious disease test center. The current and planned in-vitro studies, focusing on SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, follow previous positive pre-clinical test results with stenoparib as a treatment of SARS-CoV-2 first announced on 26 August 2020, and since published in the peer-review journal mBio (mbio.asm.org) on 19 January 2021. The previously announced data showed that stenoparib inhibits SARS-CoV-2 as a single agent, and in addition that stenoparib, in combination with remdesivir, was also active in inhibiting the virus. The concentration of stenoparib required for virus inhibition was lower in the combination study with remdesivir than in the single agent study. Since the B.1.1.7 virus variant initially was labelled “Variant of Concern 202012/01” by Public Health England (PHE), an agency of the UK Department of Health & Social Care, in a publication on 21 December 2020, it has spread rapidly within the UK, and has since been detected in all EU/EEA countries. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has modeled a trajectory indicating that this variant will become predominant in the U.S. in March 2021. In South Africa, the B.1.351 variant of SARS-CoV-2 emerged independently of B.1.1.7. This variant shares some mutations with B.1.1.7. Cases attributed to this variant have been detected in multiple countries outside of South Africa, and this variant was reported in the U.S. at the end of January 2021. The ongoing testing of stenoparib at the at the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute is part of the first steps of a potential therapeutic expansion of this drug, an orally administered phase 2 anticancer agent, to anti-viral applications. Stenoparib is one of very few drugs that have been reported, based on ongoing or completed pre-clinical tests, as a potential treatment for patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 or the B.1.1.7 and/or B.1.351 variants of Coronavirus. Allarity intends to continue to test stenoparib against various Coronavirus strains, beyond the current testing. Steve Carchedi, CEO of the Company, said, “Allarity Therapeutics is committed to developing novel treatments that change the course of disease in areas of high unmet need. Our recent research and development work with stenoparib as a potential anti-viral treatment for COVID-19 is no exception. We are proud to be one of the very few companies leading development of a possible treatment for COVID-19 and for the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. We are also proud to continue our priority clinical development of stenoparib as a potential best-in-class treatment for ovarian cancer. ” Steen Knudsen, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of the Company, further noted, “We are optimistic that the additional anti-viral testing of stenoparib against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants will be as encouraging as previously seen with SARS-Cov-2 results. As new variants of Coronavirus become more and more prominent, the need will increase for potential treatments for the many that may still be and become infected during this pandemic.” Allarity Therapeutics plans to advance stenoparib into human clinical trials as a potential therapy for COVID-19 and is working opportunistically on securing funding to advance such trials. In addition to investigating whether stenoparib has therapeutic potential as a possible treatment of SARS-CoV-2, including lineages B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, Allarity Therapeutics is also currently evaluating stenoparib for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in a Phase 2 clinical trial at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA U.S.A.) using a DRP® companion diagnostic to guide patient enrollment and improve therapeutic outcome. Stenoparib is a novel small molecule (oral), targeted inhibitor of Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase (PARP), a key DNA damage repair enzyme active in cancer cells. Allarity holds global, exclusive rights to stenoparib under an existing license with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), in the fields of cancer therapy as well as anti-viral therapy. About Allarity Therapeutics Allarity Therapeutics (Nasdaq First North Growth Market Stockholm: ALLR.ST) develops drugs for personalized treatment of cancer guided by its proprietary drug response predictor technology, the DRP® platform.

89,3129,"Intel is working hard to renew its processor catalog and Alder Lake will be a prominent platform, the newest from the chip giant in many years by the change of architecture and the complete transition to the processes of 10 nanometers. If last week we saw the versions for desktop computers, today we get other equally interesting: the Intel Alder Lake-P that will be intended for laptops.

Intel presented at CES the main lines of what these CPUs will offer, its hybrid architecture in the purest style of the design philosophy proposed by ARM that is used massively in devices such as smartphones, but without announcing models, prices or expected availability by the end of the year. We also know that the platform will cover all computational segments.

Intel Alder Lake-P

The group of laptops is preferential. The sale of new desktop computers continues to plummet although many users continue to use these machines and we update it by buying all kinds of components at a good rate. But in the global market for new equipment, laptops, convertibles or 2-in-1s are in command, those that pull the PC bandwagon.

The first of the Alder Lake-P has appeared in the database of the test site Geekbench. It has 14 physical cores in a 6 + 8-core design. The first six would be Big core high-performance ‘Golden Cove’ series, while the latter would be the ‘Gracemont’ intended for less demanding computing tasks. A design that is widely used in mobiles and tablets and that can work very well in laptops, taking into account the need to conserve battery consumption and the greater energy efficiency that is assumed in this type of novel designs in PCs.

Another feature to take into account is that only the first group of cores would have enabled the hyperthreading so this CPU could handle a total of 20 threads. The maximum working frequency indicated in the test is 4.68 GHz.

The Geekbench test does not focus on the CPU itself but on the results of the graphical section. Is a Iris Xe GT2 with 96 execution units at a speed of 1.15 GHz and that gets 13,449 points. Not bad for an integrated and resembles the score of a GeForce GTX 660 Ti.

In any case, the graphics section will not be the main point of interest of these Intel Alder Lake-P, if not its novel hybrid architecture. For those needing higher performance, Intel will launch the Tiger Lake H-series, new gaming and enthusiast-grade notebook processors later this quarter. It is the high-performance variant of the 11th generation Core “Tiger-Lake” processors, “U” and “Y” series (low and ultra low voltage) released in the fall and is intended for machines where power matters more than consumption and autonomy.

The Alder Lake will be the following and truly innovative due to the comments and other last generation components such as the LPDDR5 memories and the arrival of the PCIe 5.0 interface.",Intel Alder Lake-P CPUs for Laptops Featured on Geekbench,1,en
90,3130,"This story is being continuously updated…. New updates are being added at the bottom…..

NOTICE: We’ve compiled a comprehensive Android 11 update tracker for all the major OEMs and carriers, and will be updating it continuously.

Original story (published on April 08, 2020) follows:

In order to be part of Google’s Android One program, OEMs have to meet certain conditions set by the search giant. One of these conditions is to exclude any third-party apps from the pre-installed OS, leaving users with what is essentially AOSP.

Another condition that is equally important, more so to end-users, is the promise of at least two Android OS upgrades from the time of purchase. This means the device should run on at least three different OS versions, including the pre-installed version.

In addition to affordability alongside regular security patches for up to three years, the Android OS software update policy attached to Android One devices is what keeps many glued to the latest Nokia smartphones.

Matter of fact, the HMD Global licensee is one of the few brands that guarantee at least two major Android OS upgrades to the most budget of phones like the Nokia 1 and Nokia 1 Plus. With this in mind, we can easily tell which devices are also in line for the next Nokia Android 11 update.

“The budget has announced big-ticket projects to add to the digital capabilities with the next general census in the country being the first digital one and along with marque MCA 21 project this is likely to garner massive ‘crown jewel’ assets in terms of the sensitivity and quantity of data. As these projects are rolled out it will increase the importance of security as the government builds the tools and workflows supporting these services. These projects will need to prioritize solutions such as Zero Trust Access, automated endpoint security, users awareness training to counter a range of threats, and will also need to ensure that solutions such as software defined networking and multi-cloud services are implemented securely.

The real challenge in securing these digital assets that will continue to be targeted by both criminal and nation state (APT) actors is the availability of skilled resources. Fortinet is committed to closing the cybersecurity skills gap through our CSR training programs. The Fortinet Security Academy Program is provided free by nineteen leading universities in India to equip students with the skills necessary for a career in cybersecurity. By supporting these leading universities in India, we’re arming the next generation of security leaders with the skillset and knowledge the industry so desperately needs.”

Alok Dubey, Chief Finance Officer, Acer India

“At Acer, we believe that the Union Budget 2021 announcement has covered several important issues faced by the economy and is going to bring growth opportunities despite the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several areas where the honourable Finance Minister has announced allocations of funds. This year the government aims to spend Rs 1.97 lakh crore on various PLI schemes over the next 5 years, starting this fiscal. This is in addition to the Rs 40,951 crore announced for the PLI for electronic manufacturing schemes which will accelerate growth opportunities for the industry. And, we look forward to a complete policy and leveraging the same to kickstart domestic manufacturing.”

Sudhindra Holla, Director, Axis Communications, India & SAARC

“We are upbeat on the six pillars of the government agenda including focus on infrastructure, innovation and R&D that is all set to strengthen India’s power as a global digital hub. We are optimistic by the renewed focus on road safety with advanced traffic management system with speed radars, variable message signboards, GPS enabled recovery vans along with the outlay of ₹ 2.28 lakh crores for developing the highways, roads, and railways. Good to see pertinent steps taken to revitalize the economy with key focus on allocating budget for healthcare, metro railways, ports, airports, and logistics to boost urban infrastructure. These in turn will be stepping stones towards invigorating Smart Cities planning and urban development and help in generating more jobs.”

Rajeev Singh, Managing Director – BenQ India

“A very significant budget as India is coming out fast from effects of COVID 19, Government has given strong emphasis on spending on Infrastructure along with big push for Atmanirbhar Bharat. Alongside, there is no change in direct taxes largely which were moderated for companies last time. This will mean more money in the system and will act positively towards faster growth of economy. Government has also given additional push to education and skill development segment in the budget which will result in extensive use of technology which in turn will give a boost to virtual classroom and Blended and Hybrid Learning.”

Ramanujam Komanduri, Country Manager, Pure Storage India

“Budget 2021 looks promising and rightly focuses on public healthcare, given the disruption caused due to the pandemic. We are particularly excited about the Finance Minister’s announcement of smooth delivery of digital services as part of the next wave of digital revolution. AI, ML, and Data Analytics are making greater inroads in India, as was observed in the budget. These are all essential elements of the modern data experience. We are looking forward to the next phase of Digital India which will be a big growth driver for businesses and individuals alike.”

Suman Reddy, managing director, Pega India

“As the first budget during recovery of the pandemic, we are optimistic that the slew of measures announced on healthcare and infrastructure will provide impetus to the economy. The agenda to focus on the six pillars including infrastructure, innovation and R&D clearly sets India on a path of recovery. In a significant break from tradition, Government’s Atmanirbhar package focuses on increasing spend towards the creation of jobs and rural development, generous allocations for development schemes, handing more monetary benefits to the common man, and easing rules to attract foreign investments. Enhancing the digital backbone of the country, the announcement on the fintech hub at the GIFT -IFSC and R&D investment of 50,000 crores over 5 years will ensure that the overall research ecosystem of the country is strengthened with a focus on identified national priority thrust areas. The move to establish a National Digital Educational Architecture (NDEAR) in the context of a Digital First Mindset to ensure digital learning, as well as planning infrastructure, will empower the youth of the nation.

Nikhil Rungta, Country Manager, India, Verizon Media

“Taking insights from the learning curve of Covid-19, the government has done well to take appropriate measures to improve the lives of citizens and pave way for economic recovery.”

“This is a ‘get well’ budget with an expansionary outlook and focused on growth. Given the times it might not be a radical budget, but it is practical and thoughtful, which will propel consumption and growth of business. This budget has also rightly signalled the need for greater inclusion in India’s workforce. Women being allowed to work in all sectors and in night-shifts with adequate protection, and social security benefits extended to gig workers will provide an impetus for women to step up their contribution towards Aatmanirbhar Bharat.”

Vamsi Krishna, CEO & Co-founder, Vedantu- a pioneer in LIVE and Interactive online tutoring platform

“The National Education Policy has been a strategic move towards guiding the development of India’s education. To strengthen the policy further, this Union Budget is focusing on initiatives like National Digital Educational Architecture (NDEA) which will provide a diverse education eco-system for the development of digital infrastructure, educational planning, governance and administrative activities. The complete shift from using assessments to not only judge the cognitive levels of the learner but also using it as an opportunity to identify the unique strengths and the potential, is a student centric approach which will lead to the holistic development of a child and provide them a greater edge, globally. Further, I would like to see more investments & budget allocation to go into the education sector to enhance it with more trending technologies which will make education accessible to students in the farthest corners of the country.”

Balajee Sowrirajan, Managing Director, Samsung Semiconductor R&D (SSIR)

“We are very optimistic with the focus given on Innovation and R&D being identified as one of the key pillars, I believe ‘Design for India’ will gain momentum and localization of product designs will lead towards an aspirational and Innovative India. These will lead to the next phase of inclusive growth with increased emphasis on skilling and job creation. Furthermore, with a significant increase in Capex from 4.39 lakh crore to 5.54 lakh crore, the Atmanirbhar Bharat Initiative will be strengthened with more focus on domestic manufacturing and production, laying the foundation for the 5 Trillion Dollar Economy by 2030.”

Rakesh Deshmukh, Co Founder and CEO, Indus OS

“The announcement of the National Language Translation Mission is a much needed effort by the government to reach our citizens in the language they understand. At Indus App Bazaar, the usage of apps in Indian languages on our platform has increased 2.2 times last year. We believe that with an enhanced app store ecosystem we will be able to break linguistic barriers and adding more value to the next half a billion Indian customers. Moreover, for Atma Nirbhar Bharat to be successful, the focus should be on technology innovation as a whole. We appreciate the government’s focus on innovation and R&D in the budget 2021.”

Mike Chen, General Manager, TCL India

We do welcome the recent PLI scheme of the government. However, we need to ease up the duty imposed on raw materials keeping in mind the make in India thought. We should also be getting added incentives so that transformative measures can be taken. The industry contributes 25% of the country’s GDP.

Varun Babbar, Managing Director, Qlik India

“The Union Budget 2021 is truly a balanced and reformative framework that looks forward to bolstering an economy towards faster recovery and growth which was otherwise ravaged by the pandemic. We appreciate the government’s vision of an “Atma-Nirbhar Bharat” by providing economic assistance through tax reliefs, incentives and new policies. Continued support in areas like education and technology as well as providing breathing room for startups through initiatives like providing tax relief for one more year will help to kickstart a resilient economy for all industries. The government’s allocation of Rs. 1500 crores towards promoting digital modes of payment will also boost India’s digital payment infrastructure. Aligning with our focus to provide active intelligence and real-time analytics, the government’s allocation for infusion of Rs. 20,000 crores will help to reform the country’s surge in digital payments for the post-pandemic future”.

Ramesh Mamgain, Country Manager, India and SAARC, Commvault

“ The Union Budget 2021 is sui generis considering that it is India’s first-ever ‘Digital Budget’. The gesture of doing away with the paper versions of Budget underlines government’s commitment towards PM’s ‘Digital India’ vision. A renewed focus on infrastructure would mean accelerated technology adoption, which cannot be accomplished without data privacy measures, propelled by data protection. This approach would help in strengthening India’s data protection framework to protect individual information, with investments in key technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to secure cloud-based infrastructures.While the capital expenditure on the physical connectivity – road, railway and port – has been highlighted throughout, I am sure that digital connectivity will ultimately become a cornerstone of everything we do in the current times. Overall, it is an inclusive and pro-growth budget, presenting a balanced stance on the pathway to recovery.”

Sameer Katole, CEO, Crossloop

The Hon’ble Finance Minister laid major emphasis on enhancing domestic manufacturing of electronic equipment. The Union Budget 2021 has a strong focus towards the revival of the economy and extensive plans for Atmanirbhar Bharat. It shows extreme commitment towards a strong comeback for the sectors which faced major backlashes in 2020. The budget covered several demanding issues faced by the economy earlier and with an attention concerning startup community, the extension of tax holiday for start-ups by one more year is an important decision made. This will encourage the survival of startups and give them the required support for bounce back. Further, the increased spending on PLI for electronic manufacturing schemes is a positive sign. The 2.5% taxation on manufacturing of smartphone parts is also a vital decision as it will boost the inclusive growth of the country and further bring major changes in the consumer electronic and domestic manufacturing segment.

Yashash Agarwal, CEO, Gamezop

The proposed broadening of the definition of Small Companies to include those up to Rs. 2 Cr. in paid up capital (as opposed to current limit of Rs. 50 lakh) as well those who have turnover of up to Rs. 20 Cr. (as opposed to Rs. 2 Cr. currently) is meaningful.

Companies that qualify as Small Companies are subject to lesser number of compliances in conduct of board meeting, internal financial control reporting, annual return and financial statements, and so on.nHopefully, from here we will see further reduction in compliance burden for startups.

S Sriram, Chief Strategy Officer at iValue InfoSolutions

“Budget 2021 was positive given the challenge around higher fiscal deficit due to lower income. It is great to see emphasis on growth front keeping fiscal deficit priority low for the next 2-3 years. The key highlights of the budget include additional allocation to health and wellbeing in a Covid ravaged year with Rs 35,000Cr allocation to Covid vaccination with 4 Indian vaccines shortly. It is also great to see 35% enhancement of Government capital expenditure at Rs 5.54 lac Cr to revive economy around Road, Rail and Metro infrastructure. It is encouraging to see focus around disinvestment with 2 PSU banks and 1 Insurance company being planned for the year with Rs 1.75 lac Cr target. FDI in insurance enhancement from 49% to 74% augers well for a country with very low penetration. The voluntary vehicle scrapping policy is set to help auto sector and address the pollution challenges. While Rs 20,000Cr PSU bank recapitalisation looks on the lower side, reopening of IT assessment cases period reduction from 6 to 3 years should give comfort to tax payers on documentation. Planned LIC IPO should set the mood right on disinvestment. The government could have put more money in the hands of people to sustain the recovery along with sops to Business on CapEx investments.”

Prashanth GJ, CEO at TechnoBind

“Increased spend on Healthcare and Infra are welcome moves – as this will have a cascading effect on the economy in the medium term. Whether it is Highways or Railways the enhanced allocation is very encouraging. Also interesting is the ‘Bad Bank’ which will help address the stressed assets through an ARC model. This will help keep the Banking system insulated from the spike of bad loans that are expected now – thereby allowing them to do business as usual by giving the much-needed support of credit in the system. The MSME allocation has been doubled – this too will help SME businesses in general which is a big market for us in the country. Support for furthering the idea of Digital India is also seen and it is very welcome – encouraging digital payments and the use of AI/ML in governance is exciting. Emphasis on Digital Payment is very good as this will go a long way in bringing in financial inclusion. Provisions in the GST and customs duty rationalization is something we look forward to.”

Ashish P. Dhakan, MD & CEO, Prama Hikvision India Pvt. Ltd.

The Union Budget FY 2021-22 is a transformative budget with positive resolve for India to grow further with a vision of the AtmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan that compliments the ‘Make-in-India’ initiative of the Government. AtmaNirbhar Bharat is an expression of 130 crore Indians, who have full confidence in their capabilities and skills. The Union Budget has identified the six pillars of Atmanirbhar Bharat’s vision. On behalf of Prama Hikvision, we welcome the progressive and visionary budget and look forward to economic growth and stability.

The budget has sincere intent to provide momentum to strengthen local manufacturing capabilities. The Production Linked Incentive scheme (PLI) is a welcome move by the government. The review of the customs duty structure is clearly seen as a move towards promoting the domestic manufacturing. We hope that the review of the custom duty structure will be done after extensive consultation with the key stakeholders.

The move to strengthen the overall research ecosystem to boost innovation and R&D in the country, an outlay of Rs 50,000 crore, is being announced, for National Research Foundation. It is a big step for accelerating innovation and R&D in India. The budget clearly shows government’s mega thrust on developing Infrastructure, Road Transport, Waterways, Airports, Railway, Metro Rail, ‘MetroLite’ and ‘MetroNeo’. It is commendable for its inclusive growth agenda, overall a gradual step toward Atmanirbhar Bharat.",Industry Giants Welcome Union Budget 2021-22,1,en

100,3140,"Having raised the roof with its path-breaking wireless charging design, Xiaomi seems to have taken modularity as the newest mantra. But on a road with a poignant past, does it have the bearings to come out covered in splendour?

In what has been a theme of innovation from Xiaomi’s corner, it seems that the popular Chinese tech company is now up to working on a smartphone equipped with a detachable rear camera module.

Reports of the Xiaomi smartphone with modular design, which were spotted in discovered patents by eagle-eyed sources, seem to hint that the smartphone could support cameras of all sorts of shapes and sizes.

And the buck doesn’t stop there, as the Chinese smartphone maker is also up to its eyes in coming out with a smartphone design, pretty similar to what we’ve seen from the Samsung Galaxy Z fold series. In this case, the module looks like it can be attached to the top of the phone for indulging in some selfies. This solution offers an edge-to-edge display with no notch or hole-punch cutout.

If the patents do come to fruition, it would add another pioneering milestone for Xiaomi, should the smartphone manufacturer choose to roll out it out in 2021.

From the finesse in the filed patents, Xiaomi clearly looks to be in the middle of something special, with a view to gathering solutions in modular design implementation by ticking off the boxes in the full-screen and notch-less display. Images in the documents show the rear camera module with multiple lenses that can be removed from and assembled on the top of the device to be used as a front camera, making use of a magnetic suspension for attaching.

The new patent filed at the World Intellectual Property Organisation still doesn’t give out much, but it appears that the camera side of things will likely also include a receiver, a wireless transmission module, among others.

On the other side, the foldable smartphone that recently surfaced on Weibo looks to be equipped with a sizeable display crease running through the middle. However, it is yet not clear whether the patent filed for the detachable camera will be a part of Xiaomi foldable smartphone or still a few years away from being a relaity.

At a glance, concerns about the phone’s water and dust resistance do come to mind. But then again, seeing as there’s no telling when the company intends to implement the design and launch it in the market, is very much mired in the shadows.

Speculations aside, the design has evoked a throwback to a concept that has a murky past and was much hyped when it was first mooted by Google. Let us look at what transpired at the Project Ara, and what roadblocks their design faced, which could help us gauge where Xiaomi stands with its current vantage.

The Star-Crossed Project Ara

Coming from the shed of one of the world’s most resourceful tech companies, signs of Google’s deeper interest in rolling out a modular smartphone were revealed way back in 2011. Making a slew of focused purchases, the tech giant acquired a hub of patents from an obscure and floundering Israeli modular phone company, Modu, for $4.9 million.

As ambitious as the concept put forward by Project Ara’s team looked, it had its bases in simplicity. Seeking to come out with an evolved concept design, Project Ara wanted to reimagine the smartphone as a series of smaller, LEGO-style bricks. The thought was, to bring to life a device that could be attached, rearranged, and swapped out in seconds. The inspiration came from the high-end PC market, where different components of the computer can be replaced, forgoing replacing the whole package every other year.

The ground-breaking concept didn’t look far away either, considering Google was at the helm of the project.

It appears that Xiaomi’s smartphone with detachable camera is page taken from Google’s project Ara book.

Just to jot down what the people were about to get, Project Ara would have enabled smartphone users to upgrade their smartphones just by replacing a module, no bothersome repairs or buying out a completely new model for every bump. Helping reduce the issues of e-waste, it was touted to be the flag bearer for the uber distinctive smartphones in the years to come.

And yet, when the prototype design was released, let’s just be polite and say the reception it received was merely lukewarm, notches below the reigning flagships at the time.

The reasons were because two familiar foes in cost and technical issues reared their ugly heads time and again.

After the pilot test of the device, having made many more iterations, the ill-fated Project Ara was shelved because of an inability to put a stopper on the device’s cost and rise above its technical hurdles. Contrary to the project’s original vision, the eventual design did not even allow users to swap out any of the phone’s processor, battery, or display. Fatigued with disappointment, Google ended up licensing the tech to third parties.

Glimpses of the scarred modular Project Ara have subsequently been found in models like the Moto Z3 Play, the LG G5, and the present counterparts in the Samsung foldable series.

It is why the subject of the modular smartphone design brings back echoes of such a painful past. Many a player has tried to scale its peak, yet all have faltered. With the momentum and nous that Xiaomi has acquired through its series of high profile and piquing launches, it does look as though the Chinese smartphone giant could be the chosen one to succeed where others have not.

If the demons do not resurface.

SAN FRANCISCO, FEBRUARY 22 (IANS): Smartphones sales worldwide declined 5.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020 which marks an improvement in the market compared to the sales slump in the full year, Gartner said on Monday.

Overall, global sales of smartphones declined 12.5 per cent in full year 2020.

The launch of the 5G iPhone 12 series helped Apple record double-digit growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Apple surpassed Samsung to retake the No. 1 global smartphone vendor spot, said the report.

The last time Apple was the top smartphone vendor was in the fourth quarter for 2016.

""The sales of more 5G smartphones and lower-to-mid-tier smartphones minimised the market decline in the fourth quarter of 2020,"" Anshul Gupta, Senior Research Director at Gartner, said in a statement.

""Even as consumers remained cautious in their spending and held off on some discretionary purchases, 5G smartphones and pro-camera features encouraged some end users to purchase new smartphones or upgrade their current smartphones in the quarter."" Samsung experienced a year-on-year decline of 14.6 per cent in 2020, but this did not prevent it from retaining its No. 1 global smartphone vendor position in full year results.

It faced tough competition from regional smartphone vendors such as Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo as these brands grew more aggressive in global markets.

In 2020, Apple and Xiaomi were the only two smartphone vendors of the top five ranking to experience growth.

Huawei recorded the highest decline among the top five smartphone vendors which made it lose the No. 2 position to Apple in 2020.

The impact of the ban on use of Google applications on Huawei's smartphones was detrimental to Huawei's performance in the year and negatively affected sales, Gartner said.

""In 2021, the availability of lower end 5G smartphones and innovative features will be deciding factors for end users to upgrade their existing smartphones,"" said Gupta.

""The rising demand for affordable 5G smartphones outside China will boost smartphone sales in 2021.""",Worldwide smartphone sales down 5% in Q4: Gartner,1,en

Motorola, the Lenovo-owned tech giant, is working on its new over-the-air charging technology that was recently showcased by Xiaomi as well. Chen Jin, Lenovo China’s General Manager took it to the Chinese social networking site Weibo, wherein he posted a 48-second video that showcased how the company's new over-the-air charging technology works. The video really doesn't reveal much but shows how the new wireless technology can charge multiple devices or smartphones at once. The video shows two Motorola Edge smartphones, wherein one is placed at a distance of 100 cm and the other kept at 80 cm distance.

However, the video shows the charging stops when the charging dock detects a human hand, in front. Other than the teaser video, there is not much revealed about the new over-the-air charging technology by the company.

Xiaomi too had unveiled its over-the-air charging technology earlier this week called the Mi Air Charger. Xiaomi thankfully revealed a lot more on the Mi Air Charger, compared to Motorola that offers 5W of remote power for over-the-air charging. The Mi Air Charger would support multiple device charging and is likely to soon work with other smart devices like wearables, smart speakers, smartwatches, and more. Unlike the Motorola over-the-air charging technology, Xiaomi could charge efficiently even while there were physical obstacles.

There is no clarity as to when Motorola or Xiaomi would launch this technology for consumers to use commercially.

Motorola had recently unveiled the Motorola Edge S smartphone that sports a 6.7-inch IPS LCD display with Full HD+ resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate. The device comes powered by Qualcomm’s new 870 processor in China and includes a camera setup of 64 MP main sensor, 16 MP ultrawide sensor, 2 MP depth sensor, and a 3D Time-of-Flight sensor.

115,3163,"UVnano Technology To Eliminate Bacteria

Let's address the elephant in the room- the bacteria-killing technology by LG that promises to disinfect the earbuds. It is the tiny charging case that is touted to kill 99.9% of E. Coli & S. aureus bacteria on the speaker mesh of the earbuds in ten minutes when you put them inside it for charging. The UV LED function works only when the charging cradle is connected to the power cable. ​LG hasn't specified which form of UV light the charging cradle uses to kill bacteria. We know that the company's bacteria-killing robot uses UVC (most amount of energy) to kill harmful bacteria by disinfecting surfaces.

Put Earbuds In Case To Make Them Germ-Free

As the true wireless earbuds mostly stay inside our ear canals, they can gather dust and various forms of bacteria over time. Prolonged use can cause skin irritation and several other issues to the in-ear cavity which can lead to various forms of health issues if not treated on time. Moreover, the bacteria-killing tech can be useful if the TWS earbuds are being worn by multiple users in the family. You can simply put them in the case to get disinfected while charging to be handed over to a family member to maintain hygiene in daily use.

Well, the UV bacteria-killing tech and the germ-free truly wireless earbuds sounds cool and might help LG sell some extra pairs of TWS earbuds; however, it is the audio quality and other performance parameters that matter most. Let's find out how HBS-FN7 fares in the other departments.

LG ToneFree HBS-FN7 Design- Tiny Puck-Shaped Case With Wireless Charging Support

The HBS-FN7 earbuds ships inside a tiny puck-shaped charging case that supports Qi wireless charging. The minimally designed compact case (Black & White color options) has a soft rubberized finish that feels good to touch and is less prone to smudges and fingerprints than the glossy cases. The left side of the charging case has a pairing button and the Type-C charging port has been positioned at the backside. The case has an LED light at the front that glows green when you open the lid and glows solid red when you plug the case for charging. There's a second LED at the bottom that glows solid blue to show the status of UVnano acting on germs to disinfect the earbuds.

Earbuds Design And Wearing Experience

Unlike the case, the earbuds come in a glossy finish which isn't much of an issue as the overall fit and finish are very premium. But what truly sets these earbuds apart is the in-ear fit and wearing experience as LG has done a wonderful job in getting the fit and material right. The stem-shaped earbuds are among the most comfortable truly wireless earbuds I have tested in the last few months. The wearing experience is one notch above the most sub-20k truly wireless earbuds available in the market. The feather-light buds have adjustable ear gels that fit perfectly in my ears.

IPX4 Water-Resistant Earbuds

The tighter in-ear seal provides great comfort and also prevents the buds from falling out while running or working out. The tighter in-ear seal also minimizes outside noise seepage which results in an immersive audio listening experience. The buds can be worn while extreme workout sessions when you are sweating as they are IPX4 water-resistant. The charging dock isn't though, so be careful with that.

All things considered, LG ToneFree HBS-FN7 earbuds have become my favorite TWS earbuds from wearing and comfort point of view.

LG ToneFree HBS-FN7 Touch Controls

To make the most out of LG ToneFree HBS-FN7, you need to install the LG Tone Free application (Android & iOS) on the paired device. The app is very neatly designed and allows you to customize touch controls, audio modes, and run software updates. The in-app equalizer lets you choose from four presets- Immersive, Bass-Boost, natural, and Treble boost. You can also create two custom modes to match your audio taste. Moving on, the app also offers an option to lock the touchpad on the earbuds to prevent unwanted touches, enable notification settings and locate earbuds via the ‘Find my earbuds' feature.

As far as touch controls are considered, by default, you can touch once on either of the earbuds to play/pause music and answer an incoming call. Touch twice to end a voice call or to control volume. You can skip to the next/previous song by tapping three times on the earbuds. The touch controls work without any performance issues and ensured a smooth user-experience.

And lastly, long-pressing the earbud activates the modes- Ambient sound, Noise canceling. Besides, there is a myriad of touch panel settings that can be customized as per convenience.

LG ToneFree HBS-FN7 Audio Performance

While I am not entirely blown away by the audio performance of the LG ToneFree HBS-FN7, I am very impressed by the sound clarity and the way these buds handle different sound elements, especially the mid-high frequencies. LG ToneFree HBS-FN7 features silicone-infused drivers that produce very clean and immersive sound. The volume levels are decently loud but could have been a tad louder, for my taste.

The soundstage and handling of different frequencies remind me of the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ which also does not prioritize any particular frequency and prevents overlapping. The well-defined soundstage creates a very engaging listening experience, especially when you tune into high-resolution files. There's no distortion while listening to music at max volume, thanks to fine sound adjustments done by Meridian Audio. I tuned in to my favourites tracks on Tidal and most-used OTT apps and experienced engaging and immersive audio.

Crisp Highs And Rich Treble

The sound setup ensures crisp high notes and rich treble response which makes these buds a good package for vocal-heavy tracks, live music, and tracks with varied musical instruments. The low-frequency response is good but the bass response could have been tighter. If you are a serious bass head and prefer head rattling bass delivery, look further. LG's focus is on delivering crisp vocals with pristine clarity, great treble response, and decent bass delivery.

The earbuds support SBS and AAC Codecs and I enjoyed listening to music on AAC with these TWS earbuds. The app offers a decent equalizer with four presets- Natural for a clean, balanced sound, Immersive for a more three-dimensional performance, Bass Boost for extra power and depth, and Treble Boost to bring greater clarity to vocals. The immersive profile sounded the best on most of the devices I paired the earphones with.

Voice Calling Performance and ANC

Similar to the sound delivery, the LG ToneFree HBS-FN7 also maintains a very clean profile with voice calls. The earbuds have a triple-microphone setup that seems to be doing a wonderful job in ensuring crystal clear voice calls. The earbuds also come equipped with ANC but the setup seems somewhat lacking in blocking external noises, despite a good implementation of the silicone ear gels with an interior spiral design. The ANC isn't as powerful as rival TWS earbuds; in fact, the recently launched Enco X (Rs. 9,990) manages to offer a very powerful ANC in the sub-10k price segment.

LG ToneFree HBS-FN7 Connectivity And Battery Life

The LG ToneFree HBS-FN7 works on Bluetooth 5.1 and also supports Google Fast Pair and popular features like ear-detection. The earbuds connect to paired devices in a jiffy and maintain a stable connection with no latency issues as such while playing mobile games. However, the ToneFree HBS-FN7 is marred by major latency issues when paired to an Android TV via Bluetooth.

As far as battery life is concerned, the earbuds can last for up to 6 hours 30 minutes at 80% to 100% volume with ANC disabled. Switching on the ANC will reduce the battery life by up to 90 minutes on the same volume levels. The wireless-charging enabled case can add another 14 hours of battery life which means these earbuds can give you a total audio playback of up to 20 hours, quite impressive. But the feature that sets the LG ToneFree HBS-FN7 apart is the fast-charging support. A 10-minute charging time can give you an audio playback of about 90-minutes, which comes quite handy in the daily routine.

Verdict

The LG ToneFree HBS-FN7 checks almost every box of a good pair of truly wireless earphones; however, the expensive price could be a deal-breaker. The rival TWS earbuds from Apple and Sony have set very high benchmarks in terms of audio performance. The HBS-FN7 earbuds also manage to produce clean and immersive audio but the overall audio delivery is a notch below. However, LG has nailed the design and these buds offer a very comfortable fit for longer listening sessions. The battery life is also good if not excellent and the fast-charging feature is mind-blowing.

Further, the bacteria-killing UVnano technology is another highlight feature that can be a good add-on if you are very particular about hygiene and also appreciates new technology.",LG Tone Free (HBS-FN7) TWS Earphones Review: Clean Audio With Twist Of Innovation,1,en
116,3164,"New Delhi: New Delhi: Indian smartphone makers such as Lava and Micromax are likely to be the most affected by the increase in basic customs duty ( BCD ) on import of mobile phone sub-parts as the move will mostly impact the sub-Rs 10,000 category, as per industry executives and analysts.They say the levy of duty will add cost pressure on brands competing in the sub-Rs 10,000 category, but market leaders such as Xiaomi—which dominates the segment—will be able to absorb the cost, which can be offset with the kind of volumes they sell.The government has proposed that with effect from April 1, BCD on import of printed circuit board assembly (PCBA), camera modules and connectors should be raised to 2.5%. For PCBA and moulded plastic for manufacture of charger or adapter, duty should go up from the existing 10% to 15%. Whereas, other inputs and parts of chargers will attract 10% duty, from nil earlier.An industry executive said featurephones and entry-level smartphones will be worst impacted where it is difficult to manage the bill of materials.“This will adversely affect a brand like Lava... we are already battling the blow of 10% hike in duty on display assembly, which came in October 2020 amid severe global component shortage,” he said.But the budgetary allocation of Rs 50,000 crore in strengthening local R&D on priority sectors will aid Indian players like Lava to take on global competition, he addedLava and Micromax did not respond to ET's emailed queries.Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint , said that the levy may increase prices by 3-4% in the short term as the bulk of the sub components already have local suppliers like for camera modules, PCBAs, chargers, connectors etc.Completely built-up units (CBUs) of battery chargers incur 15-20% customs duty while handsets attract 22.5%. Certain sub-assemblies of phones such as display panels, printed circuit boards, mechanics and die cut parts are also liable for 10% duty to encourage greater value addition in India. As of now, components totalling nearly 50% bill value of a mobile phone incur import duty but local value addition is only 15%-19%.India though has achieved significant expansion in local manufacturing of these products in the last five years, say experts.Exports of battery chargers have grown by almost three times, from $122 million in 2017 to $471 million in 2020, according to the latest data collated by ICEA . In the same period, smartphone exports grew from a meagre $209 million to $2,875 million, whereas feature phones exports rose from $2 million to $961 million, data showed.",Proposed duty levy on components to hit Indian handset makers most: Industry,1,en

118,3168,"The South Korean giant’s Display unit has recently announced OLED Panel for outdoors as well as UL-verified for Sunlight Visibility. The display is said to be made with a new organic material to achieve a peak brightness of more than 1,500 nits.

Samsung Display said its new OLED display will significantly enhance the world of 5G smartphones, delivering bright and clear outdoor visibility. Samsung Display’s new OLED panel has achieved an ‘Ambient Color Gamut’ rating of 73% of the DCI-P3 standard, and a peak brightness of more than 1,500 nits (the maximum brightness that a single display can now provide).

We’ve seen how Samsung’s OLED displays on its smartphones have evolved in the past few years and its recent S21 series, especially the S21 Ultra packs one of the best smartphone displays ever. So, this is why most Samsung Displays are free from outdoor visibility issues.

It is because, according to Samsung, the display depicts colours through a proprietary light-emitting process that embraces a wide colour gamut, usually resulting in a high degree of chroma, or intensely vivid colour. Thanks to this feature, OLED displays can now deliver vivid image quality outdoors, even where visibility is poor in general.

“In the 5G era where people spend more and more hours on their smartphones, it is crucial that we ensure a display performance that delivers bright and clear picture quality in both indoor and outdoor spaces,” said Dennis Choi, vice president and head of the Mobile Display Marketing team at Samsung Display. “Though it can be used with many types of smartphones, Samsung’s new OLED is particularly well suited for 5G devices as it will provide greater device usability and therein, more value for consumers,” he added.

The Samsung OLED material’s peak brightness goes over 1,500 nits, it is currently only used in Galaxy S21 Ultra and the panel is likely to be selected by several other global smartphone manufacturers for a new generation of flagship 5G smartphones.

By 2023, India is estimated to have 650-700 million smartphones as the number of internet users in the country crosses 800 million, according to a McKinsey report. India’s digital economy has the potential to create 60-65 million jobs by 2025. The report finds that India’s digital surge is well under way on the consumer side, even as its businesses show uneven adoption.

Indian government’s push for digitisation was further fueled by last year’s pandemic, which disrupted conventional ways of doing businesses. Conferences became virtual events, schools were converted into online classrooms, and the corporate team outings were replaced by online pizza deliveries.

“If India’s digital leap doesn’t match its growth in data literacy, millions of users will be left vulnerable.”

Huge swathes of the population have embraced internet-based services. However, this tectonic shift begs the question: What will happen to all the generated data? Is the online platform your kid uses to learn algebra susceptible to malware? What happens with the location data of millions of people who have migrated to online payment services?

How many of the users are asking these questions? Not many. They trust the big tech to take care of it; all one has to do is press the OK on the prompts. In an ideal case, a user should be immune to exploitations. But, it is slowly becoming obvious that customers are the product for many of these service providers. Indian regulators are yet to catch up with their Western counterparts in antitrust hearings and similar lawsuits directed at the big tech. Or maybe there isn’t as much action happening in India to be worried about. In that case, the regulators need to prep its population. With the kind of surge in internet usage in India, it’s imperative to educate the masses on how their data is being used.

For example, Facebook can track your apps to bombard you with customised ads. Ad revenue accounts for most of Facebook’s profits. The social media giant is incentivised to scrape as much as data it can to convince you to buy things you never knew you needed.

For better or for worse, privacy policy changes triggered a mass exodus of WhatsApp users to safer messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram. Facebook-owned Whatsapp immediately issued a clarification to stop the departures, and many stayed back; who wants to miss their group chats. Until recently, a large section of Indian population was oblivious to data privacy issues.

Blaming Facebook for it’s not-so-transparent data mining strategies is fair. But, what would be the excuse for the exploitation that occurs on accounts of user’s ignorance. “Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them,” urged Apple’s Steve Jobs back in 2010. Things have changed since then. The internet speeds have upped, and phones are now machine learning applications that process millions of data points. The scale at which the data is generated is unprecedented. So, Jobs’ advice to be relentless in making people know what they are getting into is what all service providers must consider. After a decade, Apple is finally paying heed to Jobs’ remarks. The above picture compares the privacy labels of Whatsapp(left) and Signal(right).

Apple’s Privacy Nutrition Labels

“Data brokers collect data on 700 million consumers worldwide, creating consumer profiles with up to 5,000 characteristics.”

In a recent report, Apple illustrated various ways in which data is exploited. The underlying mechanism can be summarised as follows:

Apps are embedded with trackers. An average app has six trackers.

Trackers are used by developers to allow third parties to collect and link data.

Data is regularly collected and sold, licensed, or otherwise disclosed to third parties by the Data Brokers.

Apps request access to more data than is required.

Apple announced that their devices would inform its users on who is using their data. The Cupertino-based company has declared war on internet giant Facebook, whose whole business runs on ad revenue. Apple has divided the privacy label into three categories: data that is used to track you; linked to you; and data that is not linked to you.

Apple provides users with the “Ask App not to Track,” option to keep the developer from accessing the system’s IDFA or advertising identifier that is often used for tracking. Apple also makes sure apps comply with their policies.

“Apple’s App Tracking Transparency will require apps to get the user’s permission before tracking their data.” See Also Opinions How APIs Breathe Life Into ML Organisations

Apple attributes its success to four principles. The company is adamant on collecting only the minimum amount of data and processing data on the device instead of sending them to Apple servers. While informing people is key in maintaining transparency, the phone maker underlines the importance of hardware and software integration to keep the data secure.

However, Apple’s privacy labels have a lot of room for improvement. For example, Spotify lists “coarse location” as one of the data points. It is difficult for many to understand the mechanism behind the highly discouraging jargon. Though Apple has a long way to go, it at least has begun a dialogue, a movement, which is expected to force other service providers to follow suit.

Quantifying Data Dignity

We have discussed data brokers, ad tech exploitations and many things the complex web of apps on your phone are subjected to or subject you to. According to Apple, this data — when pieced together, shared, aggregated, and monetised –makes up a $227 billion-a-year industry. And, all this is happening as we speak without our notice.

But, how do we put a price tag on data in an unbiased way?

A recent research lists the important valuation schemes to put a price tag on the data such as task-specificness, fairness and efficiency. To formulate a metric that would help price the data, the researchers designed a framework that is equivalent to Shapley value, which is popular with profit allocation schemes. Shapley value attaches a real-value number to each player in the game to indicate the relative importance of their contributions.

Also Read: Get Paid For Your Data, But How?

Jaron Lanier, a tech pioneer, estimates that the total value of data from a four-person household could fetch around $20,000. Lanier urges to look beyond monetary benefit. He wants people to retain their “data dignity.” Data exists because an individual exists and they should have the final say on what happens to their data while getting paid if they accept to share. Today, markets are ruled by data-driven solutions and there is an immediate need for a robust framework that will restore the data dignity of an individual.

122,3174,"Poco launched the Poco M3 budget smartphone in India today. The phone, priced starting at Rs 10,999 succeeds the Poco M2, one of the most popular budget phones of 2020. Here’s all that’s changed with the new Poco M3 in comparison to the Poco M2.

Poco M3 vs Poco M2: Specifications

The Poco M3 and the Poco M2 feature the same 6.53-inch FHD+ screen with Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3 on top. However, the new Poco M3 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 SoC over the Poco M2’s MediaTek Helio G80 chipset. While both these chipsets should give you roughly the same performance, we will wait to give you the exact comparison after we get our hands on the new Poco M3.

Chipset aside, the Poco M3 and Poco M2 both feature 6GB RAM as standard. However, the new Poco M3 uses LPDDR4X RAM that should give you slightly faster performance than the LPDDR4 RAM chips on the Poco M2.

Also, while both the Poco M2 and Poco M3 feature 64GB and 128GB internal storage on the two available storage variants, the M3 features a faster storage type. The UFS 2.1 (on the 64GB variant) and UFS 2.2 (on the 128GB variant) storage should give you faster read and write speeds compared to the eMMC 5.1 storage on the Poco M2.

Poco M3 vs Poco M2: Camera

Both the Poco M3 and the Poco M2 feature very different camera setups. The Poco M2 has a quad-camera setup on the back with a 13MP main camera, an 8MP ultra-wide camera, a 5MP macro sensor and a 2MP depth sensor. Meanwhile, the Poco M3 features a triple camera setup with a 48MP main camera sensor, a 2MP depth camera and a 2MP macro sensor. Both the phones feature an 8MP camera on the front.

While the Poco M3 ditches the ultra-wide sensor, it has a bigger 48MP sensor as the primary camera lens that should give you much better images than the 13MP sensor on the Poco M2.

However, whether you would want the 48MP camera or the 13MP camera with an 8MP ultra-wide sensor will be a matter of personal choice. If you do a lot of landscape photography capturing wide scenarios, the Poco M2’s ultra-wide sensor will give you the edge. On the other hand, if low light camera performance is important to you, the bigger 48MP sensor on the Poco M3 should be a better option than the Poco M2.

Poco M3 vs Poco M2: Battery life, charging

The Poco M3 features a 6,000mAh battery that is larger than the 5,000mAh battery on the Poco M2. The extra capacity will let the Poco M3 last longer than its predecessor. However, both phones feature 18W fast charging so the comparatively smaller battery on the Poco M2 will fill up faster than the larger Poco M3 battery.

Poco M3 vs Pock M2: Other features

The Poco M3 also features a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, compared to the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor of the Poco M2. While this one is again a matter of personal preference, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor gives you a cleaner looking back and also lets you unlock the phone without picking it up when it is placed on a flat surface.

The new Poco M3 also features a stereo speaker setup that should give you a better, more immersive experience while enjoying games or music than the mono speaker on the Poco M2. Two speaker outputs also make it less likely to block out the phone’s sound while holding the phone in a landscape position during gaming sessions.

Other features and specifications on the Poco M3 and M2 are largely the same. While the Poco M2 is available in red, black and blue colours, the Poco M3 is available in blue, black, and yellow colours. The M3 also features a new design on the back, with a large camera module, similar to the one we saw on the OnePlus 8T CyberPunk Edition.

The 5G chipsets market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 52.7 per cent from 2020 to 2027 to reach $23.5 billion by 2027. Factors such as the growing demand for high-speed data services, rapidly developing smartphone technology, and the proliferation of IoT & connected devices are driving the growth of this market.

“However, the high cost of equipment, the fragmented spectrum harmonization model, and rising cybersecurity concerns hinder the growth of this market,” read a report by Research and Markets.

Asia-Pacific is projected to command the largest share

In 2020, Asia-Pacific is projected to command the largest share of the global 5G chipsets market, followed by North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. The large share of this region is mainly attributed to the presence of major technology players manufacturing 5G chipsets and higher adoption & proliferation of 5G technology.

Based on chipset type, the application-specific integrated circuits segment is estimated to command the largest share of the market in 2020. The large share of this segment is primarily accounted for its low cost of manufacturing for high volume production, higher efficiency, better performance than other ICs, and higher adoption by cellular network providers for cost-saving.

Based on frequency, the 5G chipsets market is segmented into below 1ghz, sub 6ghz, and above 24ghz. In 2020, the sub 6Ghz segment is expected to command the largest share of the market. The large share is primarily attributed to its ability to provide widespread coverage in densely populated areas of cities and flexible deployment of ubiquitous 5G network coverage. Further, the sub 6Ghz frequency can penetrate through walls and travel farther distances.

Based on application, the 5G chipsets market is segmented into automotive & transportation, smart factories, smart cities, gaming & entertainment, and smart retail. In 2020, the smart cities segment is poised to command the largest share of the overall 5G chipsets market. 5G chipsets are used in solving key issues and requirements in smart cities, such as infrastructure & real estate management, prompt access to services, efficient transportation & logistics, public security and surveillance, efficient utility management, intelligent mobility, environment & pollution monitoring, and smart lighting solutions.",Proliferation of IoT & Connected Devices Driving 5G Chipset Industry,1,en

132,3188,"Over the last one-year, remote working has picked up at an unprecedented pace and now more than ever before, people are working in places outside of the conventional ‘office’.

While there are plenty of perks for employees who work remotely like better-work life balance and improved productivity due to reduced commute time, they also face several challenges like increased distractions and background noise.

Given that many industry experts predict that the future of work is hybrid working, i.e. employees splitting their time between remote working and working in office, it is imperative that organisations equip their employees with the right collaboration tools, no matter the work location.

For Poly, the pandemic has ripped the bandaid off what we already knew: work is work, whether or not there’s a workplace. People still need to connect reliably and clearly to perform.

As offices reopen, video and audio solutions will be more essential to connect to workers outside the office. The future of work requires sophisticated equipment that’s easy to use, platform agnostic and reliable.







Below are the best tools from Poly, the collaboration industry expert that enables workers to be productive or connected no matter where they are.

POLY SYNC USB/BLUETOOTH SMART SPEAKERPHONES – A remarkable sounding three-in-one device, it’s a personal speakerphone, a portable music speaker and a smartphone charger all in one. Its compact, sleek design and carrying case make it perfect for users on the go. The USB and Bluetooth speakerphones are designed to enable today’s need to work from anywhere – whether that’s a remote work location at home or a conference room in the office. Poly Sync speakerphone’s USB and Bluetooth® connectivity options offer flexibility, while its intelligent microphones can easily detect voices throughout the room to enable crisp audio quality for both work and entertainment. For seamless voice integration, connect Poly Sync speakerphones to your Siri or Google voice assistant and check even more off your to-do list without lifting a finger

POLY EAGLEEYE MINI HD VIDEO CONFERENCING CAMERA – You may have heard the acronym K.I.S.S. before, but as it turns out, Keep It Stupid Simple is a design principle that was first used by the US Navy in 1960. Effectively, it means that any designs or systems should be as simple as possible. In that vein, the EagleEye Mini is about as simple as it gets: Installing the device is as easy as plugging it in; no drivers required for installation means you’ll be ready to start conferencing in just seconds. This handy little USB-powered HD video conferencing camera connects to your laptop or home computer, and features 1080P HD video to bring clarity to your meetings, while 4x electronic zoom and 74-degree field of view makes conference calls feel like in-person meetings.

POLY VOYAGER FOCUS UC -Even though you may be working from home office, your favorite café, or even the office, distractions are everywhere. The day you work from home might be when your neighbor decides to start on their home renovations. An excited group of teenagers in conversation might decide to sit down at the table next to yours at the café (with proper social distancing, of course). Or your office colleagues might decide to start singing “Happy Birthday” to someone in the group as you’re trying to get on with an important conference call. A headset like the Voyager Focus UC comes in handy with its ability to filter out the background noise, while projecting your voice clearly and confidently so your contribution to the meeting can be heard. When it’s time to take a music break between a back-to-back calls, the Voyager Focus UC delivers rich bass, crisp highs, and natural mid-tones to let you enjoy your favorite tunes.

POLY VOYAGER 6200 UC – Here’s a headset for those that want something professional yet versatile. The Voyager 6200 UC neckband delivers professional-grade audio performance for mobile and PC calls and features an immersive stereo for the music lovers. The earbud is comfortable, stable, fits nearly all ear sizes and shapes and is easy to put on and take off, while the neckband contours to any user while remaining lightweight. And if you’re afraid of missing calls because it is so comfortable you forgot you are even wearing a neckband headset? Fret not, the vibrating neckband signals you to incoming calls and alerts. Bring your voice to the forefront and minimize distractions with its four omni-directional microphones – the person on the end will thank you for the hyper-clarity audio (you’re welcome). Finally, let’s face it, as digital natives; none of us work on one device at a time – switching between the computers, the tablet, the phone. The Voyager 6200 UC can pair with up to eight devices, connecting to two at a time. You no longer have to fumble with pairing and unpairing your devices just to get a discussion, or some music, going.

POLY VOYAGER 5200 UC – Yesterday’s idea of an office job is likely going to be hugely different from what office jobs will likely look like in the years to come, as employers and corporations are starting to consider shifting a larger proportion of their workforce to a Hybrid Working model. For these types of workers, the ability to effectively communicate with customers and colleagues will be more important, especially during time away from the office desk. Enter the Voyager 5200 UC, a mono Bluetooth headset which lets you work from wherever you like, and with all-day comfort. Six layers of WindSmart technology and four omni-directional microphones work in tandem to reduce distracting background noise, letting nothing get in the way of a clear connection. A pocket-sized design also makes this handy headset a compact addition to your mobile arsenal, without cramping your style.

134,3192,"Redmi 9 Power is the latest smartphone in the Redmi 9 series after the Redmi 9, Redmi 9 Prime, Redmi 9a and the Redmi 9i. Unlike the other smartphones in the series with either MediaTek Helio G25 or G35 entry-level and mid-range Helio G80 SoC in the Redmi 9 Prime, this one is powered by Snapdragon 662 SoC. It also comes with an improved 48MP main camera and a whopping 6000mAh battery. Is the phone worth the price? Let us dive into the review to find out.

Box Contents

Redmi 9 Power 4GB + 64GB storage version in Blazing Blue colour

USB Type-C Cable

2-pin 22.5W charger

SIM ejector tool

Clear protective case

User manual

The Redmi 9 Power has a Full HD+ display with a pixel resolution of 2340 × 1080 pixels, 19.5:9 aspect ratio 2.5D curved glass screen with gentle rounded corners. It has a large 6.53-inch screen size and a pixel density of about 394 PPI. The display is bright, thanks to 450 nits brightness and the colors are vibrant. Sunlight legibility is good, since it has a Sunlight display that uses hardware-level technology to adjust the contrast of each pixel in real time, so images are less affected by glare. It doesn’t have an HDR display like the mid-range Redmi Note 9 series phones.

Since this has a 19.5:9 aspect ratio screen, you can pinch to zoom to fill the screen when you use video apps, but the content is cropped. There is also an option to hide the notch that adds a black bar on the top. Under the display options there are different options to adjust colors and contrast based on your preference. There is also a reading mode that lets you reduce the display’s blue light emission, so it doesn’t cause eye strain when you are reading at night. There is Dark mode with customizations, similar to other phones running MIUI 12.

Above the display there is an earpiece on the top edge, but it doesn’t have a notification LED. The proximity is on the bezel, but it is hardly visible. It also has a gyroscope and a magnetic sensor, otherwise known as a magnetometer. There is also an 8-megapixel camera on the front.

There is a small bezel below the display, which is almost the same as the Redmi Note 9.

Coming to the button placements and ports. The volume rockers and the power button that also comes with a fingerprint scanner are present on the right. It has dual SIM and a microSD card slot on the left arranged in a single tray. The 3.5mm audio jack is present on the top along with the IR sensor and a vent for the speaker. The primary loudspeaker speaker grill, USB Type-C port and the primary microphone are present on the bottom.

This doesn’t miss out on the dedicated dual SIM and microSD card slot.

On the back there is a 48-megapixel camera along with an 8-megapixel 119° wide-angle lens, 2-megapixel depth sensor and a 2-megapixel macro camera. This has a slight camera bump due to the large sensor, but the camera lens is protected by a scratch-resistant glass and the case also protects it. Even though the phone has a large screen, it is compact to hold. This has a textured polycarbonate back that offers improved grip and resistance from fingerprints. There is a large Redmi branding on the back. We have the Blazing Blue colour, but it also comes in Mighty Black, Fiery Red and Electric Green colours. It has Splash proof P2i coating and corrosion-proof ports. The phone weighs 198 grams even though it has a huge 6000mAh battery, and the weight distribution is good. Overall the build quality is good for the price.

Camera

The phone packs quad rear cameras, that includes a main 48-megapixel primary rear camera with single LED Flash, 1/1.2″ Samsung GM1 ISOCELL sensor, 0.8μm pixel size, f/1.79 aperture, secondary 8-megapixel camera with 119° ultra-wide angle lens with OmniVision OV8856 sensor, f/2.2 aperture, 1.12μm pixel size, 2-megapixel depth sensor with OmniVision OV02B for portrait as well as 2-megapixel camera with SK Hynix Hi259 for macro with 1.75μm pixel size and f/2.4 aperture. It has an 8-megapixel front-facing camera with OmniVision OV8856 sensor, 1.12μm pixel size and f/2.05 aperture.

The camera UI is familiar with other Xiaomi smartphones running MIUI 12 with flash, HDR, AI, Filters (Normal, Vivid, Gold Vibes, Lime, Gourmet, Film, Amour, Movie, Soda, Sky blue, Blush, Childhood, Lit, Travel, Rise, Cyberpunk, Black ice, B&W and Classic) and Google Lens on the top. Pressing the menu option shows Movie frame, show gridlines, straighten, Macro, Tilt-Shift, Pro colour and Timed burst. There is a front camera toggle on the bottom along with option to select modes such as Pro, Video, Photo, Portrait, and More option has Night, 48MP, Short Video, Panorama, Documents, Slow motion, Time-lapse and AI watermark. Pro mode lets you adjust white balance, focus, shutter speed (1/4000s to 30 seconds), ISO (100 to 4000) and option to select main and ultra-wide lens. You can also shoot in RAW in Pro mode and enable focus peaking, exposure verification and more options. Beautify option for the front camera lets you adjust several features, in addition to smoothness. The 21:9 wide portrait feature which is called ‘movie frame’ mode works both rear camera front cameras and for video, but there is no separate portrait video mode.

Xiaomi has enabled Cam2API by default, so you can side-load ported Google Camera APKs for advanced editing including RAW capture.

Coming to the image quality, daylight shots came out well, but the white balance is not the best at times since some images look dull even in daylight, but the AI mode helps in such cases. After 4-in-1 pixel binning you get 12MP output. HDR shots are better with improved dynamic range, but the macro shots from the 2MP camera is just average. Wide-angle shots are good as well, and the portrait shots have good edge detection. 48MP mode that offers a lot of details, but some images can go up to 20MB in size. Even though there is no telephoto lens, it uses the software for offering 2x zoom, which might be handy sometimes, but it loses details.

Low-light shots are decent, thanks to 4-in-1 Super Pixel technology that lets the camera’s sensor hardware combine 4 pixels into a single 1.6μm large pixel, and the night mode is even better making the images brighter offering more details, but there is noise and the ISP can’t handle when it comes to low-light shots. Images with flash are good and the flash is not overpowering. Daylight front camera shots are decent for an 8MP camera, but low-light front camera shots are just average. Portrait shots have decent edge detection even though it is done using software.

Check out the camera samples (Click the image to view the full resolution sample.).

It can record videos at 1080p at up to 30 fps from both main and ultra-wide cameras, and it also has slow motion 720p resolution video at 120fps. You can also shoot 720p 30 fps video using macro camera. Check out the video sample below.

Software, UI and Apps

It runs Android 10 out of the box with MIUI 12 on top. It has Android security update for November 2020, and should get Android 11 update in the coming months. MIUI 12 that was introduced last year brings several features including improved animation, Dark mode 2.0, Privacy improvements and more. This has all the usual set of features such as Dual Apps, Second Space, App Lock, Quick Ball and more. Inside the special features option there is Game Turbo, Video toolbox, floating window and Lite mode, but misses out Quick Replies and Second Space features that are present in Redmi Note 9 series.

Apart from the usual set of utility apps, Google apps and Xiaomi’s own set of apps, it comes pre-loaded with Amazon Shopping, Facebook, WPS Office, Amazon Prime Video and LinkedIn app and some games. It also asks for additional app installation during setup, which you can skip. You can easily uninstall these apps, but these come up when you reset the phone.

Xiaomi is infamous for showing ads on its phones with MIUI, which the company says is done in order to support the development cost of its own apps. If you don’t want to see ads, you have to disable recommendations while setting the phone up, promoted apps and in Xiaomi’s own apps such as Music, Mi Video, File Manager, Mi Drop, App Vault, and others. You can also uninstall these apps by following the procedure here without rooting the phone.

Since the phone has an infrared sensor for remote function, it comes with Mi Remote that lets you control your home appliances easily. Out of 4GB RAM, you get 3.7GB of usable RAM, and about 1.5GB of RAM is free when default apps are running in the background. Out of 64GB internal storage, you get about 47GB of free storage. Since this has UFS 2.1 storage, we got sequential read speeds of about 492MB/s. Since the 128GB storage version has UFS 2.2 storage, it will have faster read speeds.

Fingerprint sensor and Face unlock

The phone has a fingerprint sensor on the ride side, embedded into the power button. It immediately unlocks the phone just by keeping your finger on the power button so that you don’t have to press it. This is more convenient compared to the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and faster than the in-display fingerprint scanner. You can add up to 5 fingerprints. You can also use the fingerprint for app local and payments in apps. The phone also supports face unlock, but it is not as secure as fingerprint since it can be unlocked with a photo.

Music Player, FM Radio and Multimedia

The Mi Music Player is the default music player with usual Xiaomi audio effects and equalizer. It also has FM Radio with recording. Audio through the speaker is loud. Since the phone has stereo speakers audio is louder than the mono speakers found in most smartphones in the price range, which is a good move. Audio through earphones is good as well.

This comes with Widevine L1 support out of the box so that you can enjoy HD content on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hotstar and other streaming apps. This is good for a phone in the price range.

Dual SIM and Connectivity

It supports 4G VoLTE for Reliance Jio, Airtel and other networks and support Dual 4G VoLTE that offers 4G in both the SIM cards at a time. There is Snapdragon X11 LTE modem, but you can’t expect carrier aggregation in the price range. Other connectivity options include Dual-Band Wi-Fi 802.11 ac (2.4 + 5GHz), Wi-Fi calling / VoWiFi support, Bluetooth 5.0 LE and GPS. It also has USB OTG support that lets you connect USB drives. Moving on, the call quality is good, and we did not face any call drops and the earpiece volume was loud. It has stock dialer and messaging apps.

The Redmi 9 Power’s body SAR is 0.865 W/Kg (Distance:15mm) and head SAR is at 0.868W/Kg which is below 1W/kg, even though the limit in India is 1.6 W/kg (over 1 g).

Performance and Benchmarks

Coming to the performance, this is powered by an Octa-Core Snapdragon 662 11nm Mobile Platform, which has 4 x Kryo 260 Performance CPUs (A73-based) clocked at up to 2GHz and 4x Kryo 260 Efficiency CPUs (A53-based) at up to 1.8GHz. It has Adreno 610 GPU with support for Open GL ES 3.2, Open CL 2.0, as well as Vulkan 1.1 graphics and 4GB LPDDR4x RAM.

We did not face any issues or frame drops in games. It gets a bit warm on intensive gaming and 4G data use, but it doesn’t get too hot to handle. That said, check out some synthetic benchmark scores below, which shows good performance compared to other mid-range chips, but it can’t beat the Helio G80 when it comes to gaming.

Battery life

Coming to the battery life, the phone has a 6000mAh (typical) built-in battery making it the largest battery in the Redmi phone. It lasts for a whole day even with heavy use, and with average use it lasts for two days, thanks to optimization in the MIUI 12. Since the phone has support for 18W fast charging, it takes about 1 hour for 0 to 50% and 0 to 100% takes over 2 hours using the bundled fast charger. This is decent for a phone in the price range. If you want faster charging, the POCO M2 Pro is an option, which comes with 33W fast charging at slightly higher cost. At the launch event the company said that it offers enhanced lifespan battery with 1000 charge cycles compared to 600 cycles in other phones.

It achieved One Charge Rating of 19 hours and 59 minutes in our battery test, which is almost same as the Redmi Note 9 Pro and the Pro Max that come with a 5020mAh battery. This might be due to the SoC used an the optimization, which might be different. Battery life is based on different factors such as software optimization and the processing power that requires to power the phone, so if the phone lasts for a day with heavy use, it is good.

Conclusion

At a starting price of Rs. 10999, the Redmi 9 Power is decent budget smartphone from Xiaomi. The 6.53-inch FHD+ screen good compared to most phones that only offer HD+ screen in the price range, the 6000mAh battery offers good battery life even with heavy use and the build quality is good. The camera is not impressive enough compared to the competitors and the phone has a lot of bloatware and the UI has ads.

Competition

The Moto G9 is a direct competitor that offers better camera quality and a stock Android experience for the same price. The latest POCO M3 at the price is also a good option, if you can compromise on the ultra-wide camera for 6GB of RAM and no ads. If you spend more the POCO M2 Pro is a good deal after the price cut since it doesn’t have ads, puch-hole HDR display and faster 33W charging.

Availability

Priced at Rs. 10,999 for the 4GB RAM with 64GB storage version and Rs. 11,999 for the 4GB RAM with 128GB storage version, it is available from Amazon.in, mi.com and Mi Home Stores, Mi Studios and Mi Stores.

135,3195,"Vivo S9 could launch on March 6, according to a tipster on Chinese microblogging site Weibo. The phone could succeed the Vivo S7 launched last year as a selfie-focused smartphone. With the possibility of a dual selfie camera setup, it looks like Vivo S9 can follow in Vivo S7’s footsteps as well. The tipster also shared a few specs for the phone which, if true, could make the Vivo S9 the first phone to be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 1100 SoC.

A known tipster with the pseudonym Arsenal (translated) on Weibo has said that Vivo S9 will be released on March 6. The phone is said to be the successor to the Vivo S7 which launched last August and was a selfie-focused phone with double-sided cameras. As of yet, Vivo has not shared any official information on the rumored Vivo S9 release date or its specifications.

Vivo S9 specifications (expected)

The tipster has shared some specs for Vivo S9 along with the release date. The phone can be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 1100 SoC which was announced a few weeks ago, alongside MediaTek Dimensity 1200. Both SoCs support 5G and at the time it was announced that Oppo, Realme , Vivo and Xiaomi would come out. phones powered by the new SoCs this year. If Vivo S9 comes out on March 6 with the SoC Dimensity 1100, it could be the first smartphone to wear it.

Moreover, the tipster also claims that Vivo S9 will feature a 6.4-inch display and dual selfie cameras. The main sensor on the front is expected to be a 44-megapixel sensor with an ultra-wide-angle lens. There is no information about the secondary sensor.

The Vivo S9 appears to follow the same path as the Vivo S7 released with a 44-megapixel primary sensor up front, as well as an 8-megapixel secondary sensor housed in a notch.

As mentioned earlier, Vivo hasn’t shared any information on the specifications, availability or price of the Vivo S9, so this information should be taken with a pinch of salt.

137,3197,"We took the M1-powered MacBook Air for a ride and our heads are still spinning. We get into why this ultrabook is a great base model from Apple.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

I was in the eighth grade when Apple announced its first MacBook. It was gorgeous for its time and every high schooler had to have the white polycarbonate laptop. Its design standard was set by the Powerbook G4, one of Apple’s early laptops. Then came the aluminium unibodies of the late 2000s and 2010s, offering a premium finish ultimately setting Apple apart from others in terms of design and price point; these models were a landmark of my university years.

What did they all have in common though? They were powered by Intel chipsets.

Specifications Dimensions & Weight: Height: 0.41–1.09 cm; Width: 30.41 cm; Depth: 21.24 cm; Weight: 1.29 kg

0.41–1.09 cm; 30.41 cm; 21.24 cm; 1.29 kg Apple M1 Chip: 8-core CPU with 4 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores; 7-core GPU; 16-core Neural Engine

Battery & Power: Built-in 49.9-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery; 30W USB-C Power Adapter

Storage: 256GB configurable to 512GB, 1TB or 2TB

Wireless: Wi-Fi: 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 wireless networking; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac compatible; Bluetooth: 5.0 wireless technology

So last year, when Apple announced M1, their first native chipsets for Macs, I was keen to get my hands on one. If you are going to opt for any MacBook, the space grey and gold models are the ones to go for; leave the silver behind in 2018. It is easy to keep these unibodies clean, a simple wipe-down with a microfibre cloth has it looking fresh-out-the-box in a jiffy.

Just like its predecessors, the only available ports on the device are two Thunderbolt / USB-4 ports on the left and one AUX port on the right, so be ready to invest in a connecting hub for this device.

All in working order?

The display on MacBook Air M1 is eye-catching. If you see this in a store, it will imprint on you. With practically no bezels, the 2560x1600-resolution (227 pixels per inch) Retina display shows off sharp and clear text as well as vibrant colours on a P3 colour gamut. This means, considering most users have been using sRGB for well over a decade now, display P3 offers a 25% larger colour space compared to sRGB. Editing photos and videos and creating animations on the MacBook Air M1 is a minutely detailed process.

With my 2015 MacBook Air, there were some overheating issues which stressed me out to the point of shutting it off and waiting for it to cool down. Apple paid attention to this common malady and the MacBook Air M1’s fanless design paired with the chipset sustained a lot of the battery for a neat cooling effect. In eliminating that wheezing fan noise, Apple integrated an aluminum heat spreader that dissipates the heat the system generates, so no matter how intense the task, the laptop is hush-hush.

The battery holds strong with this one; I could use the device for about 16 hours before it had to be charged from a red low battery to a white full bar – and the best part is, charging just takes an hour. As do its predecessors, this laptop charges via Thunderbolt/USB-4 and the typical Mac adapter, and, yes, I do see the rumours swirling about the return of MagSafe chargers. However, I have had loose contact issues with the MagSafe chargers for MacBook in the past. I quite like the USB-4 option as it feels secure.

Accompanying this pleasant silence is the keyboard. I am not a fan of butterfly mechanisms for keyboards, but MacBook Air M1’s Magic Keyboard is equipped with a scissor mechanism. Essentially, individual keys are attached to the keyboard via two plastic pieces that interlock in an X-form, and snap to the keyboard and the key. Compared to the controversial butterfly variant, the scissor mechanism has more travel time, allowing for better fluidity on the user’s part. Plus, there is less likelihood of dust and debris getting caught under the keys, thankfully. And, the top right key is the power button and the Touch ID key — no FaceID here.

But then...

My point of contention with this MacBook Air is the camera. Apple claims it includes their latest image signal processor (ISP) within the M1 chip, promising better noise reduction, greater dynamic range, and improved auto white balance and Machine Learning-enhanced face detection so users look their best during video calls. I did not experience this at all. In fact, there was far too much noise and grain, so much that I ended up using the EpocCam app and my smartphone as an external webcam to attain high-quality clarity during video calls. Reddit forums are spewing vitriol against the lacklustre camera, and I will admit, I did not particularly like this feature in such a grandiose device.

Software-wise, the MacBook Air sings when running on M1 and macOS Big Sur combined. The latest OS is stunning with minimal bugs. As someone who often uses Chrome and kept away from Safari due to the latter’s often glitchy performance in the past, Apple’s native browser is lightning fast and intuitive with macOS Big Sur. The widgets scheme for the desktop is easily accessible with a swipe on the Force Touch TrackPad while not cluttering up the workspace.

But best of all with M1, I noticed apps opened faster and, unlike previous models, the device did not slow down when multiple applications were open at the same time. Apple ultrabooks are not exactly famous as gaming devices but I did find myself pleasantly surprised when playing Arcade games and heavy-duty games such as The Elder Scrolls, BioShock Infinite and Firewatch. And still, no overheating thanks to the new cooling system!

NEW YORK: Popular online trading platform Robinhood said Monday that it has lined up $3.4 billion to help meet its funding requirements amid a spike in trading on Wall Street fueled by small investors driving up shares in GameStop and other stocks.

The funds are being provided by Ribbit Capital and several other venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures and ICONIQ Capital. The $3.4 billion figure includes $1 billion in funding that Robinhood announced Friday.

Robinhood needed to secure funding in order to meet deposit thresholds required by organizations that handle the trading orders placed by investors on its platform. These firms, known as clearinghouses, execute the trades placed on stock brokerages like Robinhood, and require higher deposits in order to reduce their risk during the 48 hours or so that it takes them to transfer the stock to a buyer and the funds to the seller.

“This round of funding will help us scale to meet the incredible growth we’ve seen and demand for our platform,"" Jason Warnick, Robinhood's chief financial officer, said in a statement.

Investors on social media and online forums such as Reddit have been cheerleading each other in recent weeks to drive up shares in GameStop, AMC Entertainment and other stocks. Big institutions including some hedge funds that had bet on those stocks going lower have lost billions as the shares skyrocketed.

The speculative frenzy has put pressure on Robinhood and other stock brokerages to keep up with traffic on their online platforms. Last week, Robinhood, Charles Schwab and other retail brokerages placed limits on trading of GameStop, AMC, Express and other stocks popular with small investors. The move led to a swift backlash from customers and criticism from some lawmakers claiming small investors were being treaded unfairly.

Robinhood, which is based in Menlo Park, California, initially limited investors to only selling their positions, not open new ones. It also required users to put up more of their own money for certain trades instead of using borrowed funds.

On Monday, the company was limiting users to buying four shares and five options contracts in GameStop. Traders interested in snapping up AMC Entertainment, are limited to 75 shares or options contracts.

GameStop stock vaulted from below $20 earlier this month to close around $350 as of last week. The videogame retailer's shares closed Monday at $225, down 31% on the day. Movie theater operator AMC was running at around $2 last April and surged to around $20 last week. It closed Monday at $13.30.",Robinhood raises $3.4B from investors amid surge in trading,1,en

Vivo S9 launch date is tipped to be March 6th

Vivo S9 launch date has been tipped alongside key specifications. This could be the world’s first-ever smartphone powered by MediaTek’s latest Dimensity 1100 chipset. A Weibo tipster speculates that the Vivo S9 launch date is March 6th in China. Not a whole lot is known about the smartphone at this moment, except for its name, chipset, and screen size, which is set at 6.4 inches. The leaker speculates that the Vivo S9 will come with two selfie cameras – a 44MP sensor coupled with what is very likely an ultra-wide-angle lens. A leaked render of the Vivo S9 (via Abhishek Yadav on Twitter) tells us that both camera modules will sit in a waterdrop-style notch at the centre of the screen.

Prima facie, the Vivo S9 looks like a marginal improvement over its predecessor, the Vivo S7, which came with the same selfie camera configuration. We can expect the Vivo S9 to improve upon some of its predecessor’s hardware. We already know that it will come with a newer MediaTek Dimensity 1100 and it will be interesting to see what else gets an upgrade. A recent Google Play Console listing told us that the Vivo S9 could come with up to 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and run Android 11 out of the box.

Looking at the Vivo S7 spec sheet, we can reasonably assume that the Vivo S9 will also come with an AMOLED panel and three rear cameras. Whether or not the screen will come with a 90/120Hz refresh rate remains to be seen. Although the selfie camera configuration has remained largely identical across both devices, there is a high chance of Vivo using newer hardware on the rear camera array. Similarly, we can expect to see some improvements in the battery department as well.","Vivo S9 launch date, specs tipped: MediaTek Dimensity 1100 SoC, 44MP selfie camera, and more",1,en
146,3210,"I reviewed the GTS (read review here) in November 2019 and the lookalike was indeed promising health and fitness smart wearable of its time, despite it being subjected to a few software glitches that marred the user experience. Then came the GTS 2, which brought wholesome upgrades, including the blood-oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitor and BioTracker 2 PPG optical sensor for heart rate, stress levels, and PAI score. The successor to the GTS, the second-gen health and fitness tracker had everything in place, except accuracy.

Cut to 2021, has added two new models – the Amazfit GTR 2e and GTS 2e – to expand its portfolio. Part of the GTS series, the GTS 2e is not a successor to the GTS 2 but a cheaper variant of the model priced at Rs 9,999. The GTS 2e borrows several features from the GTS 2 but does it manage to fix the accuracy issue that marred its predecessors? Let’s find out:



Design and display



Like the GTS and GTS 2, the GTS 2e takes design cue from yet it looks novel and intriguing. The GTS 2e has a 1.65-inch HD AMOLED display of 341 pixel-per-inch pixel density. This is amongst the finest displays you get in a health and fitness wearable and the touch response is fairly good too. The AMOLED panel makes the colours pop. Thanks to good brightness levels, the display is easy to read under direct sunlight. The GTS 2e supports custom display wallpapers and there are several built-in display faces too to complement a new look every day.

The rectangular display has vacuum coating for scratch-and wear-resistance and narrow bezels around it. It has a 2.5D curved glass that meets the aluminum alloy body. There is a single crown on the right that wakes up the watch and opens sports mode upon double press. At the rear, there are sensors and charging points. The GTS 2e comes with different colour themed silicone straps, which are comfortable to wear and complements the overall looks of the watch. Light in weight (25g), the GTS 2e is comfortable to wear, even while sleeping.

Features and performance





Setting up the Amazfit GTS 2e is smooth through its complementary Zepp app. The app detected the watch quickly and creates a connection through Bluetooth in no time. After the initial set-up, the app takes some time to check the new firmware update. The app interface is minimal but functional, compared to its previous iteration, which was cluttered with details and information.

Coming back to the GTS 2e, there is pretty much everything covered here with regard to sensors. It has an accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate, thermometer, barometer, altimeter, etc. Moreover, there is a built-in GPS for independent location tracking services.

The GTS 2e can measure blood-oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels, body temperature, atmospheric pressure, and altitude. It can also track the sleep cycle. Besides, there are several fitness modes, including running, cycling, and swimming. The GTS 2e registers the data and syncs it with the smartphone through the Zepp app. The app shows the data through meaningful illustrations, making it easy to understand and comprehend. For example, if you want to see how you fared throughout the week or month, you can open the Zepp app and swipe on the metric to see graphics. The app also lets you compare data.

Battery





The Amazfit GTS 2e has a 246mAh battery, which is touted to go on for about 14 days on a single charge. In real life usage, the GTS 2e lasts for about nine days on a single charge with always-on display enabled, vibration on, full brightness, 24-hour heart rate monitoring, etc. The battery time goes up slightly if you use the GTS 2e with brightness set at 50 per cent and vibration disabled.

At Rs 9,999, the Amazfit GTS 2e offers the comfort of a and the utility of an able fitness tracker. It faces stiff competition from the recently launched Mi Watch Revolve and Realme Watch S Pro. However, its minimal design, accurate health and fitness tracking, and ability to handle basics right make it a better proposition. Amazfit may have missed the mark with GTS and GTS 2 but the GTS 2e impresses on several counts and is worthy of praise.

149,3213,"On Tuesday, a three-judge bench of the apex court resumed the hearing of an appeal filed by the Sindh government against the Sindh High Court's (SHC) December 24, 2020, order to release Sheikh, The Express Tribune reported.

The bench further directed to keep Sheikh at a better location in the jail in an open room for the two days before he is to be transferred to the rest house, where security will be provided.

The British-born Sheikh will however, not be allowed to use a smartphone or the internet.

The bench also allowed his family to stay and visit at the rest house from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Before the apex court rejected the provincial government's appeal, the Sindh Advocate General (AG) told the bench that Sheikh's accomplices could attack the rest house and help him escape.

Tuesday's development comes after the Supreme Court on January 28 decided to acquit and release the four accused persons in the case, including Sheikh.

The US has heavily criticised the decision, saying that it was prepared to prosecute Sheikh in Washington.

The 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal was doing research on religious extremism in Karachi when he was abducted in January 2002.

A graphic video showing his beheading was delivered to the US consulate a month later.

152,3217,"The outbreak of coronavirus ate many businesses, the camera industry being one of them. This has been confirmed by the latest report of CIPA, the Camera and Imaging Products Association. CIPA has released its final report of camera production and shipment from January 2020, to December 2020. The report notes the trend of annual dip in the camera market further accelerated by the COVID-19.

As soon as the cameras in smartphones got better with good image quality, users prefered a phone over a traditional camera to click photos. In fact, smartphones' cameras gave birth to professional mobile photographers. Roughly, the past 11 years have been rough for camera manufacturers. They are trying their best to sustain the camera market. Manufacturers adopted new designing plans to rearrange elements in the camera bodies to make them compact and lightweight, without compromising with the image/ video quality.

The move resulted in the popularity of mirrorless cameras. Last year, the category of mirrorless cameras boosted in comparison to DSLRs and cameras with fixed lenses. The sales numbers across the board were low in 2020, but yes, mirrorless cameras stuck to its position. However, CIPA's data shows a 25.9 percent decrease in volume and a 12.5 per cent decrease in value.

If we look deeper at the losses, then it is found that the compact cameras with built-in lenses as well as DSLR cameras are responsible. Compact camera shipments were down 47 per cent by volume and down 41.3 percent by value. While DSLR cameras were down 47.3 per cent by volume and down 44.6 percent by value.

China is the only market that didn't see any drop in sales volume for 2020. In fact, the company exceeded its sales projections of the year due to Canon EOS R5 and Canon EOS R6. CIPA’s data also confirms that despite shipment volume being down, the financial reports of Canon and Nikon show that the value of units shipped is not dropping at an equal rate. This means that the fewer cameras are being sold but those that are being sold are bringing higher revenue.

Overall, cameras with fixed lenses were at 52.5 percent of volume and 56.4 percent of value, DSLRs were 53.4 percent of volume and 55.4 percent of value, and mirrorless was 75.9 percent of volume and 86.2 percent of value.

The year 2020 was not that great for camera makers but as the world recovers from the pandemic, there are chances that we may have numbers going upward in 2021.","Camera shipments, production hit due to COVID-19, reveals 2020 CIPA data",1,en

While there are plenty of perks for employees who work remotely like better-work life balance and improved productivity due to reduced commute time, they also face several challenges like increased distractions and background noise.

Given that many industry experts predict that the future of work is hybrid working, i.e. employees splitting their time between remote working and working in office, it is imperative that organisations equip their employees with the right collaboration tools, no matter the work location.

For Poly, the pandemic has ripped the bandaid off what we already knew: work is work, whether or not there’s a workplace. People still need to connect reliably and clearly to perform.

In that vein, the EagleEye Mini is about as simple as it gets: Installing the device is as easy as plugging it in; no drivers required for installation means you’ll be ready to start conferencing in just seconds. This handy little USB-powered HD video conferencing camera connects to your laptop or home computer, and features 1080P HD video to bring clarity to your meetings, while 4x electronic zoom and 74-degree field of view makes conference calls feel like in-person meetings.

Or your office colleagues might decide to start singing “Happy Birthday” to someone in the group as you’re trying to get on with an important conference call.

Highlights The Helio M80 is MediaTek’s first-ever 5G modem that works with mmWave networks

It supports up to 7.6Gbps and 3.6Gbps download and upload speeds respectively

MediaTek Helio M80 is expected to feature on a smartphone by late 2021 or early 2022

MediaTek has unveiled a new 5G modem called the Helio M80. Unlike its previous-generation offerings found on Dimensity-branded chipsets, this particular modem is compatible with faster, but less-reliable mmWave 5G networks. Some key MediaTek Helio M80 features include eight component carriers (8CC), Sub-6 GHz and mmWave dual connectivity and carrier aggregation, and Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS). The MediaTek Helio M80 also supports dual 5G SIM, dual 5G NSA and SA networks, and dual Voice over New Radio (VoNR) for more reliable connectivity. However, it will be some time before we get to see the modem in action. MediaTek says that the Helio M80 will be launched ‘later this year’ and is expected to make its debut alongside a smartphone sometime in 2022.

It has plans to enter the ACPC (always-connected PC) space too, with its upcoming MediaTek T700 modem. There are several 5G hotspots in the works too, powered by its MediaTek 750 modem.

Connecting to a 5G network over mmWave is fairly battery-intensive. That is where the MediaTek Helio M80’s UltraSave Network Environment Detection and UltraSave OTA Content Awareness technologies come in. They allow connected chipsets to dynamically adjust power configuration and operating frequency based on the network environment. The Helio M80 also integrates MediaTek’s Dynamic Bandwidth Part (BWP) technology that dynamically allocates bandwidth based on the workload.

Until now, access to mmWave 5G networks have been restricted to a handful of high-end flagship smartphones that run top-of-the-line Samsung and Qualcomm chipsets. The MediaTek Helio M80 will allow relatively affordable smartphones to connect to mmWave networks, something that is essential for the spread of 5G networks in the future.",Helio M80 launched as MediaTek’s first-ever mmWave 5G modem,1,en

Meditate because it is required for the well-being of the mind and body. Connect with self and the environment,"" Ranjana Roy added.

Dr Sutapa GuhaRay Datta, a psychologist from Kolkata, noted a significant point that 2020 is to be credited for. ""The coronavirus pandemic has taught us the value of human company and we should treasure it. Now, it is time for all of us to get digitally detoxified, otherwise our body, mind and our social skills will be at stake,"" Dr Datta told IndiaToday.in.

""Instead of WhatsApp chats, we can meet our friends and relatives in person to enjoy. Similarly, we can enjoy our meals with family without getting glued to TV screens,"" she added.

IS DIGITAL DETOX EASY?

It's true that 2020 has been a year that has enlightened individuals with lessons for an eternity but you cannot deny that it has been stressful as well. Extended work hours, incessant household chores, managing time with family and balancing all of that with some 'me-time' - sounds difficult but almost everybody managed to pull it off, with an increased number of coffee and chai cuppas though. In such times, is it possible to opt for a digital detox?

""We are living in the digital era. So, absolutely putting away the devices out of sight is perhaps not possible for those who are in certain professions. But certainly not for those who spend a lot of time on social media. Setting limits for using devices and rationally using them can be important ways to detox,"" Dr Datta said, adding, ""Detoxification of addiction to digital devices, in the present situation, is difficult if not impossible. But we cannot deny the fact that it is extremely important, keeping in mind the adverse effects of digital addiction - physical, social and psychological.""

BALANCE IT OUT

If chances of opting for a digital detox appear slim in your case, you can most definitely balance it by just doing it for one day, as mental health professional Mansi Sanghvi Bhayani suggests.

""Detox refers to rejuvenation and getting all the impurities out, and helping your body deal with all the symptoms that anything has caused. Whenever we do excess of something in the wake of several circumstances in our daily life, it causes a burnout. That burnout leads to a feeling of either running away from a situation or going for a detox,"" Mansi told IndiaToday.in.

It is important to maintain a holistic approach towards life and allot specific hours to involve yourself in mindful activities such as yoga and meditation.

""It is very good to identify that you have reached that point of a burnout and you want that kind of a detox. But practically speaking, a detox can be done for a day or two, but it cannot be a long term thing - for seven days or so. So, it is good to maintain a mindful balance so to speak between using digital devices and assigning a few hours of the day to do activities such as yoga and meditation. This will help your body release the stress that digital devices cause. Overall, maintaining a balance and approaching a holistic and healthy lifestyle is something that is going to help people develop reduction of burnouts,"" Mansi, who is also the founder of Marga - A Mind Wellness Studio in Kolkata, said.

DIGITAL DETOX FOR CHILDREN

To conclude, digital detox is as important for children as it is for adults. ""Children should be encouraged to acquire knowledge more from books rather from Googling. They should enjoy outdoor games more instead of online games,"" Dr Datta added.

184,3277,"Samsung has announced a significant price reduction for the Galaxy Z Flip 5G, one of the latest generation folding smartphones that the South Korean giant has on the market and that from now on will cost $ 1,199 from the initial $ 1,499. All smart phones tend to drop in price after a few months of marketing, but this is an official permanent cut from the manufacturer.

«Samsung is committed to making folding devices are more accessible to everyone«, explained the communication director of the company to explain the price drop of the Galaxy Z Flip 5G. It is one of the ways to bring these folding devices closer to the general public, innovative devices due to their form factor and the novelties in user experience they offer, but whose cost has so far left them out of mass consumption.

In addition to lowering the price of already marketed devices, another way to increase sales is «expand the folding product portfolio » says the executive, leaving open the way to an increase in the catalog that could approach the mid-range with completely new series or using the current ones, reducing benefits. We are likely to see more ‘affordable’ devices with these types of designs in 2021.

Galaxy Z Flip 5G, a unique folding

It is a variant of the original Flip with the same design and format, but with support for the new mobile broadband networks and a new chipset, Qualcomm’s most advanced for 2020. The terminal presents the shell type design that was common a couple of decades ago and that other manufacturers like Motorola have recovered with the Moto Razr. Hugely compact when folded, it also allows for good one-handed operation when unfolded.

The key to the terminal design is a “bending glass”. An ultra-thin glass cover that, compared to the use of polycarbonate, considerably increases the protection of the screen and avoids the resistance and robustness problems that affected the original Galaxy Fold, the first folding of the company.

The screen is the star of the whole. A Flexible OLED multi-touch with FHD + resolution, 6.7 inches diagonally and support for HDR10 +. It also has a small 1-inch secondary screen located at the bottom of the outer lid, which allows you to perform basic functions without having to unfold the terminal, receive information or notifications or answer audio or video calls.

Inside, the Snapdragon 865 Plus 5G stands out, Qualcomm’s most advanced chipset of those marketed in 2020. The connectivity section is very well covered despite its compact size, with 5G, Wi-Fi 6, USB Type C, Bluetooth 5.0, NFC, GPS and AKG speaker with support for Dolby Atmos. Its battery is not bad for its size (3,300 mAh) and it supports fast and wireless charging.

Akatsuki Head of Global IP Expansion Yuki Kawamura said that the company is actively looking for a local partner for its animation vertical. He also revealed that the company wanted to set up a dedicated team and office in India but that is on hold for now due to the Covid-19 situation.



""In the future, we are looking to set up a local office in India. We are eyeing partners for Akatsuki Inc animation vertical. We may establish a joint venture with a local partner,"" Kawamura said.





The company has already introduced its maiden offering targeted at preschoolers called Kumarba. The edutainment channel is designed to engage kids in the age-group of 2-5 years old through a series of upbeat nursery rhymes and educational songs with colorful animation.

Akatsuki aims to make animation more interactive with the power of storytelling to convey meaningful messages to the Indian kids. The channel features two main characters, a young bear boy named Kumarba and his squirrel-tablet friend, Tabris.



With Kumarba, the company aims to gather consumer insights by developing 3-5 animation properties across different themes, each with 10-13 episodes on OTT platforms and YouTube. ""We will also focus on the establishment of the animation localisation process through production of subtitles and dubbing for each language,"" he stated.



Kawamura said that Covid-19 derailed the company's original content plans. ""We had aggressive plans to create original content for India in collaboration with local artists and production houses in 2021. However, with the current pandemic, they have been pushed as traveling to India remains unsafe for all parties. For now, we are only focusing on dubbing and subbing the Japanese content but we will be bringing original content dedicated to India in the near future.""



The company will bring dubbed and subbed content in Indian languages like Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, and Punjabi. Going forward, it will add more Indian languages. It is also in talks with local studios for dubbing content in Indian languages. ""Right now, we are not working with any local players but in the future, we’ll be partnering with local localisation studios for dubbing in different languages and dialects; the discussions are in progress,"" Kawamura stated.



For 2021, Akatsuki's primary focus is to build a community following for the content IPs that it plans to introduce in India and build on them further basis the consumer insights and adoption. It will monetise these properties through merchandising offerings.



Akatsuki has entered India since it has the largest kids population in the world and there is a huge gap in the supply of quality content targeted at kids. ""This gap has become even wider with wider access to the internet and smartphones across Tier III & IV India and in the light of the current pandemic. The need for kids' content in vernacular languages as their social distance is more significant than ever,"" Kawamura pointed out.



He also mentioned that Akatsuki Entertainment Technology (AET) Fund, a venture capital fund established by Akatsuki Inc, has relationships in India through its investments in gaming, entertainment, and ed-tech startups.



""With Akatsuki Inc coming in, we are expanding our commitment to India and solving for the untapped market for original kids’ animation content. We are looking to begin by bringing Japan’s fascinating characters and stories to Indian kids in a language they can relate to,"" he asserted.



Kawamura feels that there is very limited content in India targeting the lower primary school grades and below while the demand for such content is on the rise. He is also gung-ho about the fact that there’s already a proven appetite and affinity for Japanese characters in India as reflected in the popularity of animated shows like Doraemon, Ninja-Hattori, and Shinchan.



""Japanese animation has historically been ahead of the curve when it comes to setting consumer consumption trends. With Kumarba, it’s the beginning of us bringing that wealth of animation innovation to India, customising it to make it relatable for local audiences. There are some great players in India already in the animation space, but as I mentioned earlier, there is still a huge dearth of kids-focused content relative to very high demand,"" he stated.

Original story (published on October 9, 2020) follows:

Google released Android 11 last month and several OEMs have provided the latest OS update to their devices as beta and stable versions but LG is not among them.

LG has been a bit slow with software updates as the OEM is still providing the year-old Android 10 update to its devices.

To recall, LG shared a software update schedule for LG G8s ThinQ, LG V40 ThinQ, and LG G7 ThinQ back in September.

Now, another software update schedule along with the list of devices has been shared by LG for the fourth quarter of 2020.

This time, the update schedule includes a bunch of devices including LG V50S, LG Q70, and LG X6 (2019) that will get performance updates.

Also, the OEM has shared details of the September security patch and a list of eligible devices that will receive a bunch of new features.

The devices include LG Wing, LG Velvet, LG V50S ThinQ, LG X4 (2019), LG V50 ThinQ, LG G8 ThinQ, LG Q9, LG V40 ThinQ, LG Q8 (2018), LG Q61, and LG G7 ThinQ.

These devices are slated to get new updates along with new features in the near future, although some might be receiving the updates already.

LG has released the Android 10 update for most of its devices but the OEM has been very slow with the OS update.

It must be noted that the LG G8s ThinQ Android 10 update was supposed to roll out from October 08 in India but there is still no sign of the OS update.

Today, LG started rolling out the Android 10 update to LG G8X ThinQ units in South Africa months after other regional variants of the device had received the same.

Hopefully, LG strives to deliver faster updates to its eligible devices considering many OEMs are way ahead in the game.

That said, you can check out our LG Android 10 update tracker to get the latest updates on the topic.

The US tech giant, Apple, is one of the biggest companies in the world. According to the reports, Apple might come with an in-display fingerprint sensor.

Being said that, Apple is not the first company to try out this feature. A number of premium smartphones available in the market do utilize this technology. But, the iPhone did not support the in-display fingerprint sensor. Soon, we can expect this to change.

With the speed, Apple is moving, we can very well expect upcoming iPhones to come with the in-display fingerprint sensor. Another suggestion which this report makes is that the new iPhones will not come only with the in-display fingerprint sensor. You can expect the smartphone to have both Touch ID and Face ID. A former employee quoted that an optical version could be more reliable than the existing ultrasonic technique.

Currently, Apple features the Touch ID only on iPhone SE and MacBooks. You can also spot a fingerprint sensor in current MacBook devices. Though, this sensor is shifted from the screen to the sleep button on the side in iPhone SE.

204,3300,"Not long ago, Elon Mush proudly shared the accomplishments of Neuralink – one of Musk’s companies that specifically looks after developing a brain-machine interface. At the time, Musk demonstrated the small chip with tiny wires that that could be implanted into the human brain to improve interaction with machines. If you assumed that it would take a while for the technology to work effortlessly, Musk now says that one of those chips just helped a monkey play a game with just the mind. Also Read - SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says Starlink's satellite internet speeds will double in 2021

In a recent interview on the Clubhouse platform, Elon Musk declared that Neuralink was successful in testing the chip with a monkey. Using the chip’s wireless abilities, the test monkey was able to play a video game just by using its mind. “We’ve already got a monkey with a wireless implant in their skull, and the tiny wires, who can play video games using his mind,” says Musk in the Good Time Show on Clubhouse.

Neuralink allows monkey to play video games

“He’s not uncomfortable, and he doesn’t look weird. And you can’t even see where the neural implant went in,” says Musk. He added that video game playing monkey was able to control the electronic interface completely using its mind. Also Read - Elon Musk says Bitcoin is ""on the verge"" of being more widely accepted

The wireless bit is quite important for the health of the monkey as it prevents any build-up of infection – something that could otherwise flare-up with wired connectivity in living beings. Once the technology is ready for humans in the future, it will be possible for us to completely control home appliances and other machines by just using our minds – something akin to Magneto from the X-Men.

Of course, the safety of such systems is yet to be determined and it remains to be seen as to how a chip implant in the brain affects health on the long term. Neuralink in its initial presentations pointed out new possibilities for paralysis patients as well as those with disabilities.

The N1 sensor chip can be controlled by a smartphone app and connects to the implant module inside the brain wirelessly via an external module. Neuralink is using robots to do the surgeries on animals and has so far successfully placed the chip as well as its threads successfully.

Given that Elon Musk is involved, the technology has to look cool, right? After all, his Tesla will sell an electric pickup truck, i.e. Cybertruck, with bulletproof capabilities later this year just for the sake of fun (Mushk mentioned that in an interview with Jay Leno). So, what’s his plan for Neuralink? “One of the things we’re trying to figure out is can we have the monkeys play mind ‘Pong’ with each other,” says Musk. “That would be pretty cool.”

227,3332,"Renowned Taiwanese chip manufacturer MediaTek Inc on Tuesday released a new 5G focused modem, which marks a very significant moment for the chipmaker since this is the first modem from the company to come with support for mmWave based 5G, something that its main competitor, Qualcomm already achieved.

For those of you in the dark, alongside Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd., Mediatek Inc is one of the handful suppliers of modem chips that aid devices such as smartphones to connect to cellular data networks. The company’s key customers include LG Electronics Ltd, Xiaomi Corp and more. With today’s launch, the company expects to see some growth in terms of sales, as it will finally be able to cater to customers in search of mmWave 5G based modems.

Till today, however, MediaTek’s 5G chips had been compatible with the “sub-6” variant of 5G, which is the variety being widely used in countries such as China. The sub-6 waves can give good speeds but, for the massive difference in terms of generation to generation, mmWave leads the charge.

Mediatek M80 5G Modem Specifications

Like the M80’s predecessor, the Helio M70, the M80 is an integrated modem, meaning that it will exist side-by-side alongside other components like the CPU, GPU and ISP. What sets these two apart is the inclusion of mmWave 5G, since the Helio M70 was the company’s first 5G modem, but it lacked support for mmWave 5G bands.

The MediaTek M80 has support for both modes of 5G, ie non-standalone and standalone 5G, with maximum download and upload speeds (theoretical) of 7.67Gbps and 3.67Gbps respectively.

For some context, the M80’s direct competitor, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X60 is capable of reaching 7.5Gbps download speeds and 3Gbps in terms of upload speeds, while Samsung’s integrated 5G modem on the recently launched Exynos 2100 is capable of hitting 7.35Gbps in downlink and 3.67Gbps in the uplink.

Other important features of the M80 modem include carrier aggregation across both mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G bands as well as support for Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS). Dynamic Spectrum Sharing is a technology that allows carriers to operate 4G LTE and 5G simultaneously on the same network band, so as to reserve spectrum for either one of them.

The M80 comes with MediaTek’s UltraSave Network Environment Detection and UltraSave Content Awareness technologies, which are capable of dynamically adjusting power and operating frequency based on network conditions.

When Will It Be Available?

The MediaTek M80 will be sampled to customers in late 2021, so one should not expect a commercial device with this new modem to launch anytime soon. Similarly, details about which MediaTek Soc the new modem will be paired with remain to be a mystery at this point of time.","Mediatek Announces M80 Chip, With an Emphasis on 5G",1,en

Made In India Smartphones Will Become Costly As Excise Duty Hiked By 2.5%; Exports Will Be Spared



The prices of mobile phones manufactured in India are going to increase slightly in the new year. The price hike is the result of the proposal of union budget 2021 to impose a 2.5% custom duty on the import of electronic components that are required during the manufacturing of smartphones.



The new union budget has excluded the custom duty only on exports. This means every phone that is produced commercially for domestic purposes in India will experience an increase in its price. The Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman said that the government is removing few exemptions on the chargers and components of mobile phones to add more value.



What Is The Reaction From the Industry?



The mobile manufacturing industry is not satisfied with the new arrangement. They feel that this new policy will fade away the competitiveness achieved through the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.



Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) said that the proposal will have an impact of 0.3% to 0.4% on the customers. “The mobile and electronics sector should have been spared the general removal of exemptions where there was zero percent import duty,” he said.



Besides, he also thinks that this decision will affect the 18% GST taxation since ‘Zero custom duty does not mean zero-taxation’



Was The Decision Taken Against the Industry’s Will?



Mohindroo alleged that the decision to increase mobile prices was taken against the consultation of the industry and said that the recommendations of the State Electronics & Information Technology minister were not considered. He claimed that the inactiveness of PMP and the weak exports compelled PLI to address disabilities for the sake of competitiveness.



“This spate of duties takes us right back-queering the pitch for electronics exports and we request the government to maintain the status quo,” he added.



From When Will The New Policy Be Applied?



The Finance Minister has announced that the excise duty on some components of mobile and electronics will be increased from 0 to 2.5%. These parts include printed circuit board assembly, camera modules, and connectors.



On the other hand, the duty for the manufacture of PCBA, moulded plastic, chargers and adapters will increase from 10% to 15%. The customs duty for all the other inputs and parts of a charge, and assemblies of phone like display panel, PCB, mechanics and die-cut part will be set at 10%.



Besides, build up units of battery chargers and handsets will allure a custom duty of somewhere between 15 and20% and 22.5% respectively. Currently, components on which customer dusty is applicable make up 50% of the total bill of a mobile phone.

OnePlus as a brand has earned a rapport for its premium smartphones. The brand made a debut in the market as the flagship killer. Last year, the company introduced its new smartphone lineup for the budget-conscious masses called the OnePlus Nord. The company's mid-range offering also came along with 5G network support and was one of the cheapest mid-range devices with the new network support.

The company has added several models into this lineup already including the OnePlus Nord, Nord N100, and the OnePlus Nord N10 5G. All these models were launched back in 2020. The company seems to be ready to refresh this budget smartphone lineup with a launch of the successor to the OnePlus Nord N10. The device which is hinted to arrive first this year in the OnePlus Nord series is the Nord 1 5G.

OnePlus Nord N1 5G Expected Features

The Oneplus Nord N1's development has been tipped by leakster Max Jambor. The leak only shares the moniker of the handset.

No internal features of the smartphone have been shared by the tipster. Since this smartphone is being introduced as the successor to the Nord N10 5G, we can expect slightly upgraded hardware compared to the previous-generation model.

It can't be said if the brand will be using a Qualcomm or MediaTek processor to power the Nord N1 5G smartphone. Nevertheless, this device will come with 5G network support as the name suggests. The company could make some improvements in the camera and battery department.

It would be interesting to see what all changes it brings to the table. It is worth noting that the tipster hasn't also revealed by when the company will be bringing this handset to the market officially. There is no word on the pricing either. We shall get some information in the coming days and will keep you updated with details.

242,3355,"In our comparison between Android TV and Amazon Fire TV Stick, we had noted that Google Play Store is one of the main features that differentiate the two TV platforms. It houses thousands of apps and has a much larger library of apps than Amazon’s Appstore. That said, both platforms essentially run Android under the hood, and APKs are used for packaging and installing apps. So there must be a way where you can access Google Play Store on Fire TV Stick. Well, we bring you a detailed guide on how to install Play Store on Fire TV Stick. So without further ado, let’s jump to the steps.

Access Google Play Store on Fire TV Stick (2021)

Before I proceed, let me clarify that you can’t straight up install Google Play Store on Fire TV Stick. However, there is a way that allows you to access apps directly from Play Store’s library and lets you seamlessly install the app on your Fire TV. We are going to use the Aurora Store which is an open-source client for Google Play Store and it’s completely safe to use. This is not to be confused with Play Store alternatives. So having cleared that, let’s now move to the steps.

1. First of all, go ahead and download the latest APK of Aurora Store from here. I would recommend you download the APK on your Android smartphone for easy sideloading.

2. Now, go through our guide on how to sideload APKs on Fire TV Stick and install Aurora Store. The first method would be the easiest one so just follow that. However, if that does not work then head over to other methods.

3. To briefly explain the sideloading process, you need to install Total Commander and ‘Send Files to TV’ (SFTTV) app on your Fire TV Stick from Amazon’s Appstore. After that, install the SFTTV app on your Android smartphone. Next, transfer the Aurora Store APK to your Fire TV Stick.

4. Now, open Total Commander on your Fire TV Stick and locate the Aurora Store APK. It should be available in the “Download” folder.

5. Click on it to install the app. On the next page, you will have to allow Total Commander to “Install Unknown Apps“.

9. Finally, click on “Install” and Aurora Store aka client of Play Store will be sideloaded on your Fire TV Stick.

10. Now, open it. Click on “Next” and give storage permission. Finally, you will be asked to add your Google account. I would strongly recommend not to enter your Google credentials as the app itself says, it violates Google’s Terms and Conditions. So your account may be deactivated or blacklisted by Google. Instead, click on “Anonymous” and Aurora Store will take care of it.

Note: In case, you are facing login issues or apps are not getting installed then you can create a throwaway Google account and use it on Aurora Store.

11. Finally, Aurora Store will be live on your Fire TV Stick. It looks very similar to Google Play Store. Having said that, keep in mind, the Fire TV remote does not sit well with Aurora Store. In some cases, you might have to use a mouse.

12. To give an example, here I installed Solid Explorer on my Fire TV Stick straight from the Play Store without any hitch.

13. Keep in mind, you will have to allow Aurora Store to “Install Unknown Apps“. That’s it.

Install Thousands of Apps on Fire TV Stick From Google Play Store

So that is how you can access Play Store’s library on Fire TV Stick and install endless Android TV apps and games. In my testing, the whole process was pretty glitch-free and I didn’t face any error. However, Aurora Store’s app icon was broken due to a bug in Fire TV Stick so keep that in mind. Anyway, that is all from us. If you want to learn how to add free live TV channels on Fire TV Stick then head over to our linked guide.

NEW DELHI: Citroen announced its entry in the Indian market back in 2019 and in the year 2021, we finally have some action coming from the automaker. Citroen C5 Aircross will be the French automaker’s first offering in the Indian market. It definitely is a smart move considering the robust demand for SUVs in India, but the automaker is far from promoting its new offering as a more-than-capable SUV. According to the French automaker, the USP of the C5 Aircross is that it is a comfort class offering.The Citroen C5 Aircross will be a very unique offering in India as it positions itself just below the luxury segment and a little above the premium SUV segment and it could be the first comfort class offering that the Indian audience will see. It definitely is a big gamble, but it does seem like a reasonable one. The Indian audience already has a ton of luxury offerings and we haven’t seen much innovation there and then come the hot picks of the market that include the fast-paced budget SUV and the hot hatch segment that have pampered the market with a ton of premium features already.Citroen is ready to challenge the trend and seems quite prepared to convince the Indian audience by showing that premium features and a premium experience don’t equal comfort class at all and also that the comfort level of a car is not limited to the in-cabin experience alone. TOI Auto takes a closer look at the C5 Aircross SUV to see how exactly is this offering going to cause a paradigm shift in the Indian market.Before taking a look at all the comfort class features closely, let's list them out first to get an idea of what the SUV has to offer. Some of the highlights of the Citroen C5 Aircross include the dynamic architecture with fresh exterior detailing, suspension with the progressive hydraulic cushions, advanced and flexible comfort seats, adjustable rear seats, redefined roominess, a wide range of driving and safety aids and the finely-tuned powertrain.The Citroen C5 Aircross looks like a comprehensive package up for offer which prioritizes the comfort of the occupants and offers an in-cabin experience like never before. What we usually see in the Indian market is that SUVs or cars in general, either focus too much on the features or the powertrain or the safety or the driver-centric features, but rarely does a car manages to balance out all the elements. The C5 Aircross does look promising and seems to have attained an equilibrium throughout the elements but we’ll reserve our opinions until we actually get to drive the car pretty soon.The Citroen C5 Aircross has a very unique design language compared to what we’ve seen in the Indian market till now. While the Indian audience’s opinion on the looks may differ due to their preferences, but the muscular profile of the SUV with bold and contemporary detailing on the exterior will definitely impress you. Despite having a muscular build, the SUV doesn’t look bulky or aggressive at all and adorns that elegant stance with ease. The 360-degree glazed surfaces highlighted by the chromed ‘C’ motif, the double chevron design, the curved side panels, the ‘swirl’ two-tone alloy wheels, the rear lights with 3D modules make the SUV stand apart from the crowd. The C5 Aircross is available in 4 body colours out of which 3 offer a bi-tone roof option adding to the bold stance of the SUV.The Citroen C5 Aircross measures 4500x2099x1710mm which is enough to reflect on the roominess of the cabin. The decent width and the height of the SUV lay down a rough image of the knee room, legroom and the headroom that will be offered.Now we talk about the USP of the C5 Aircross, the Citroen Advanced Comfort features and the wide range of comforts they offer. The Citroen Advanced Comfort features are divided into 4 key themes- the flying carpet effect, cocooned in comfort, panoramic life and intuitive technology.Starting with the flying carpet effect, this feature might be the most suited for the Indian driving conditions. The C5 Aircross comes with Progressive Hydraulic Cushions that offer a specially designed suspension on both sides for rebound and compression for optimum comfort. The hydraulic cushions can counter big bumps and minor road undulations with ease.The second theme, cocooned in comfort, is about the exceptional in-cabin experience offered by the SUV. The C5 Aircross comes with double-laminated front windows and acoustic windshield glass and that reduces the wind and the road noise to an absolute minimum. The Air Quality System (AQS) further enhances the experience by automatically detecting, filtering and purifying the polluted air.The third theme, panoramic life, has to offer a panoramic glass sunroof which is powered by dual electric motors with an in-built auto-reverse safety function. You get to adjust the brightness levels as per your comfort.The fourth theme, intuitive technology, is what exactly is the icing on the cake and complements the entire in-cabin experience. The C5 Aircross offers tech like 12.3-inch TFT digital instrument cluster, 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system and both the screens are highly customizable. The 8-inch screen also offers the mirror screen feature which lets you mirror your smartphone.The C5 Aircross’s interior is quite aesthetic and the metropolitan grey ambience with grey grained leather and the graphite fabric upholstery offers a plush experience whenever you enter the car. Apart from the ambience, the advanced comfort seats don’t fail to impress you either. The seats are aimed at offering a lounge-like experience and high-density foam used makes sure that the drives are comfortable no matter how long the journey is.The rear seats of the car redefine the definition of comfort completely as they come with multiple reclining positions and they can also slide up to 150mm. The foldable rear seats also result in a generous luggage capacity. The standard boot space offered is 580 litres, but with the rear seats folded, it offers up to 1630 litres of space.The Citroen C5 Aircross offers a range of safety and driving aid systems and some of the key features include automatic park assist, coffee break alert in long journeys, blind-spot monitoring system, automatic Citroen LED vision, fog lights with cornering function, grip control with hill descent assist, hill start assist, reversing camera with top rear vision, keyless entry and start and electric parking brake.Now coming to the least focussed factor of the C5 Aircross. The SUV does have an exceptional powertrain but it is a pity that it gets overshadowed by everything else that the car has to offer. The SUV is powered by a 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder diesel engine. The 1997cc engine offers a power output of 177 PS and a peak torque of 400 Nm. The engine is paired to the new EAT8 automatic gearbox. The 8-speed automatic transmission is easy to handle and can be shifted using the paddle shifters too.The SUV also offers a grip control feature with 5 modes- Standard, Snow, All-Terrain, Sand and Traction control off. The driving modes can be selected using a dial in the central console.The Citroen C5 Aircross looks very promising and appears as the perfect candidate to bridge the gap between the luxury class and the premium class. The C5 Aircross is everything a person could get in an entry-level luxury car but in a more compact and comprehensive package. The C5 Aircross also offers that little extra that everyone looks for in premium SUVs.

CEO’s review

DNA's business operations developed steadily throughout 2020. Although total revenues decreased by 1% year-on-year to EUR 934 million (946), our mobile revenue increased by 3% to EUR 552 million (536). The decrease in total revenue was mainly due to the sale of the terrestrial network pay-TV at the turn of the year and a decrease in sales of devices throughout the year due to government measures against the COVID-19 pandemic. DNA’s comparable EBITDA developed strongly in 2020, reflecting growth from both business segments. Comparable EBITDA grew by 7% year-on-year to EUR 333 million (310) and amounted to 36% of total revenues.

The total number of mobile subscriptions fell by 2,000 year-on-year due exclusively to a decrease in the number of prepaid subscriptions. Our postpaid subscription base increased by 9,000. At the same time, revenue per user (ARPU) increased by 3% year-on-year to EUR 16.8 (16.3).

During the pandemic year, DNA’s role in enabling fast and secure connections has been more essential than ever. Due to the need for social distancing, the use of video-based services increased significantly. This was reflected in the enormous increase in data volumes and a greater need for high-speed connections. A report9) released last September by international research company Tefficient shows that, once again, DNA’s customers use the most mobile data per subscription in the entire world. In addition, in a recent report10) by Omnitele Oy, a DNA subscription achieved the highest average data transfer speed in the direction of incoming traffic. The measurements were carried out in November and December in the ten largest cities in Finland.

The increased need for high-quality digital communications was also reflected in DNA’s sales of devices this year. Sales of 5G phones grew significantly and already accounted for nearly 50% of all sold phones in December. Sales of smartwatches doubled, and sales of both laptops and desktop computers increased from 2019. Installations of DNA’s 5G Fixed Wireless Access service have also continued, and feedback from customers has been positive.

DNA’s operative capital expenditure increased by 22% in January–December and amounted to EUR 171 million (140). The most significant individual capital expenditures consisted of radio network capacity expansion and development, the development of 5G readiness and fibre optic networks and transmission systems. Construction of the 5G network has progressed on schedule and by the end of the year, the network covered 1.8 million people, nearly one in every three people in Finland. Construction of the network is ongoing with dozens of base stations opened every week across Finland. As of early 2021, construction is proceeding by expanding coverage in large cities and by bringing 5G services to a large number of new cities and towns. Construction will also be focused on different parts of Finland based on current mobile data traffic capacity needs.

In October, it was also announced that Finnish Shared Network Ltd, a company jointly owned by DNA Plc and Telia Finland Oyj, will begin building a new 5G network in northern and eastern Finland in cooperation with Nokia. The three-year construction project will be launched in early 2021.

At the end 2020, more than 95% of DNA’s personnel continued to work from home. Our regular personnel surveys found that employees were able to work effectively from home throughout the year.

254,3369,"With 5G technology gaining pace in the market, companies are working hard to develop it further to offer customers stable and super-fast network connections. In keeping up with the development, Taiwan-based chipmakers MediaTek today announced their new 5G-based modem with support for both mmWave and Sub-6 GHz 5G network.

Dubbed the MediaTek M80, the new modem will support “ultra-fast speeds on both non-standalone (NSA) and standalone (SA) architectures”. It will also deliver speeds up to 7.67 Gbps in the downlink and up to 3.76 Gbps in the uplink. It will support dual 5G SIM, dual 5G networks (both NSA and SA), and dual Voice over New Radio (VoNR). These are packed in the new M80 to provide users with more 5G options and reliable network connections.

MediaTek, as you might know, is pushing 5G technology in the market with its portfolio of 5G SoCs such as the latest Dimensity 1100 and 1200 chipsets. So, with the M80 modem supporting both mmWave and Sub-6 GHz 5G networks, MediaTek aims to give smartphone manufacturers more flexibility with integrating 5G network support in their upcoming devices.

The company notes that its 5G line of modems can be “ideal for a range of devices” such as smartphones, PCs, Mi-Fi hotspots, industrial IoT applications, and others. So, the new M80 has been thoroughly tested against industry standards, providing worldwide operators support for a full range of radio access technologies. These include:

3GPP Release 16 standard

Sub-6 GHz and mmWave dual connectivity and carrier aggregation

5G NR (FR1) with more than two carrier aggregation

5G mmWave (FR2) up to 8CC

5G carrier aggregation with Mixed Duplex (TDD + FDD)

Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) ready

Apart from these, the M80 comes with the company’s 5G UltraSave technologies, on top of a power-conserving single-chip design, that enhances the chip’s power-saving capabilities. It also integrates the company’s UltraSave Network Environment Detection and UltraSave OTA Content Awareness technologies to “dynamically adjust power configuration and operating frequency based on the network environment”.

Moreover, there is the company’s Dynamic Bandwidth Part (BWP) technology that optimizes the use of bandwidth to support light or heavy data requests. Lastly, the M80 will be able to remain powered in connected standby even when there is no data-related activity as it features Connected Mode DRX (C-DRX) technology.

“As 5G rollouts accelerate, mmWave is becoming increasingly important, especially in the U.S. MediaTek’s new 5G modem integrates support for both sub-6 GHz and mmWave networks to address this opportunity and give device makers more flexibility. To advance users’ 5G experiences, the new modem supports the latest global cellular standards and specifications and it packs MediaTek’s signature power savings technologies along with ultra-fast speeds”, said JC Hsu, the Corporate VP, and the General Manager of MediaTek’s Wireless Communications Business.

The company expects the new M80 modem to reach customers later this year with the upcoming 5G devices.",MediaTek M80 Is Company’s First 5G Model with mmWave Support,1,en

Vivo is gearing up for several smartphone launches this year. The lineup includes the new Vivo S9 5G, which comes as the successor to the Vivo S7 5G. A tipster from China claims the Vivo S9 5G would debut as early as March 6. The tipster has also shared a couple of features expected on the new smartphone.

Vivo S9 5G Features Tipped

Going into the details, the Vivo S9 5G has a couple of similarities with its predecessor. For one, the phone will reportedly feature a 6.44-inch AMOLED display with a wide notch, similar to the Vivo S7 5G. Plus, reports suggest a similar 44MP ultra-wide-angle sensor for the dual-selfie camera setup on the Vivo S9 5G.

However, there are a couple of upgrades. The upcoming Vivo S9 5G appeared on the Google Play Console listing with the model number Vivo V2072A, which confirmed the Dimensity 1100 chipset. This would make the device one of the world's first smartphones with this SoC. The listing also confirmed 12GB RAM, which will likely be paired with up to 256GB storage. The phone will run Android 11 OS with FunTouch custom skin.

259,3375,"On a Clubhouse live discussion on February 1, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk who turned into an interviewer grilled Robinhood’s chief executive Vlad Tenev over freezing the GME stocks buying last week. The US video game retailer came under fire after a Reddit group of online traders, WallStreetBets, launched mass stock trading, impacting US hedge funds, as it blocked GME shares from buyers. However, the co-founder of Robinhood defended the decision to restrict trading in GameStop and other volatile stocks.

Taking a dig at the smartphone app's boss, SpaceX CEO and billionaire Elon Musk launched daring questions at Tenev in a 90-minute interview on the audio chat app. Musk told Tenev: ""Spill the beans, man"". He introduced the Robinhood's CEO as ""Vlad the stock impaler” on the show.

""What happened last week? Why couldn't people buy the GameStop shares? The people demand answers, and they want to know the truth,"" said Musk. Musk asked in his vocal debut on invite-only and iOS-only Silicon Valley’s startup app, after inviting Vlad Tenev onboard to interview him about the Wall Street Bets debacle. In the Clubhouse room with more than 5,000 participants, Musk held a live discussion about Tesla and Neuralinks, following which he stirred the excitement saying: ""Do you want to hear the real story from Vlad [from] Robinhood about what happened on the Street with GameStop?"".

Question on Reddit's targeted Wall Street hedge

As Tenev appeared on the chat, Musk fired up questions, asking why Robinhood's boss decided to put limits on customers’ trading on GME stocks and eventually sold shares without notice. GameStop’s shares last week shot 1,600 per cent in a month after a bunch of inexperienced traders on Reddit's targeted Wall Street hedge funds resulting in millions of dollars of loss for some investors. US House Democrats, meanwhile, pledged to probe the Robinhood CEO over online stock-trading chaos. Meanwhile, in a blog post, the company addressed the concerns saying, ""We’ve received questions about how Robinhood works, trading, clearing and settlement, and clearinghouses"".

In a column titled 'What happened this week?' the firm explained the incident. ""It was not because we wanted to stop people from buying these stocks. We did this because the required amount we had to deposit with the clearinghouse was so large,"" read the column. Furthermore, the gaming company continued, ""With individual volatile securities accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars in deposit requirements—that we had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile securities to ensure we could comfortably meet our requirements"".

260,3378,"The Salter Curve Smart Analyser scale is thoughtfully designed, and gives consistent, accurate measurements. It's let down by its dated companion app, which is cumbersome to use and makes weighing in and checking your stats more work than it needs to be.

One-minute review

The Salter Curve Bluetooth Smart Analyser is a body composition smart scale, which means it uses bio impedance technology to differentiate between different types of tissue - body fat, water, muscle and bone. It can also calculate your BMI and BMR (basal metabolic rate) and sync all the data with your phone so you can track your progress.

In our tests, the scale itself performed well; its measurements were generally very consistent, and closely matched those from the commercial body composition scales at our gym.

(Image credit: Future)

It's also well designed from an accessibility perspective, with clearly marked areas to position your feet, and a bright, clear display that's easy to read when standing. Its platform is slightly larger than usual, topped with robust toughened glass, and the rubberized feet fitted as standard prevent slipping on hard floors (carpet feet are also included, but using bathroom scales on carpet is generally not recommended),

Unfortunately the Salter Curve is let down by a dated app, which it very out of keeping with the smart, modern design of the scale itself, and small inconveniences here and there mean we’re inclined to recommend a scale from the likes of Withings, Garmin or Eufy instead.

Design

The Salter Curve scale is available in black and white, and has a premium feel with a toughened glass surface. Clearly designed with accessibility in mind, the platform is a little larger than average (306mm x 336mm, with areas marked to help you position your feet correctly. The reverse LED display is bright and easy to read while standing. It takes three AAA batteries (included).

It’s interesting to note that the scale comes with swappable feet for hard floors and carpet; most electric scale manufacturers advise against using the scale on carpet, as the pile absorbs some of your weight and can make the reading inaccurate.

(Image credit: Future)

Performance

We had one anomalous reading at the start when the scale miscalculated our body fat, but otherwise the Salter Curve scale was one of the most consistent we’ve tested, producing the same measurements repeatedly when we re-weighed ourselves several times.

Other than that initial blip, the body composition scores also impressed us, closely matching those from the commercial scale at our local gym.

(Image credit: Future)

We had no issues establishing or maintaining a Bluetooth connection either, and because the scale doesn't use Wi-Fi, setup is fast and straightforward. Up to eight users can connect to a single scale, which is handy for families, though it's a shame you can't assign names to be displayed on the scale; instead, each user simply has a number.

Stepping straight onto the scale will allow you to see your weight on the display, which is useful for quick check-ins. If you've moved the scale since you last used it, you'll need to tap it with your foot to calibrate it before using it.

For your weight and body composition data to be taken and sent to your phone, tap the center of the scale with your foot, then tap the central button below the display and use the arrow buttons select your user number. Most smart scales will detect which user's phone is connected and select the correct profile automatically, so this extra step is a little frustrating.

Once the display shows zero, step on and the scale will display your full stats. You can then open Salter’s app, tap the menu button at the top right, select ‘Add data’ and tap the plus arrow. Most smart scales will send this data to a connected phone automatically, so again, it's disappointing that this extra step is necessary.

Companion app

Unfortunately the Salter MiBody smartphone app looks very dated, and lets down this otherwise good scale.

As with any smart scale, you'll need to begin by setting up an account and entering your height and gender so the app can calculate your BMI. Once that's done, you can set a target weight to aim for, import body composition data, and enter body measurements manually if you'd like to record more comprehensive metrics.

(Image credit: Salter)

Your data is presented in icons on the app’s homescreen. You’ll only see weight and body fat by default; to view the scale’s other readings, tap the menu icon at the top right and select ‘Add icons’.

Tapping any icon will show a graph where you can track your progress over time. You can zoom in and out by pinching, and we appreciate the graph’s trend line, which helps you overlook small daily fluctuations caused by water and food weight.

However, it’s a shame that the graph’s Y axis starts at your lowest measurement and ends at your highest. If your measurements all fit within the ‘normal’ range, for example, you can’t see how close you are to being under or overweight, because the boundaries aren’t shown.

(Image credit: Salter)

If you have an iPhone, you can sync your data with the Apple Health app, which has a cleaner, more accessible interface.

Buy it if

You want to track weight and body measurements

The MiBody app provides lots of space to enter body measurements, which can be a reliable way of measuring changes in fat mass, and you can chart changes over time.

You find some scales hard to read

The Salter Curve scale has a clear, bright display, a large platform to stand on, and markings that help you position your feet correctly.

Don't buy it if

You want all your fitness data in one place

Salter MiBody doesn't display data from fitness trackers or third party apps, so you won't be able to see your daily activity levels or calories burned alongside your weight and body composition unless you import it to Apple Health.

You're short of time in the morning

The need to select your user profile before weighing yourself and import data manually means recording your body composition with the Salter Curve takes a little longer than with some other scales.",Salter Curve Bluetooth Smart Analyser Bathroom Scale review,1,en
261,3379,"This may seem straight out of the famous animation show named the ‘The Popeye Show’ but scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States have reportedly managed to engineer spinach plants making them capable of sending emails.

Spinach to detect explosive materials

According to reports, engineers at MIT have used nanotechnology to transform spinach into sensors capable of detecting explosive materials. The spinach plants can transmit the information back to scientists wirelessly. Whenever the presence of nitroaromatics, a compound often found in explosives like landmines, is detected by the spinach roots in the groundwater, the carbon nanotubes within the leaves of the plant emit a signal. This signal is then read by an infrared camera that sends an email alert to the scientists.

Professor Michael Strano, who led the research, told that plants are good analytical chemists.” They have an extensive root network in the soil, are constantly sampling groundwater and have a way to self-power the transport of that water up into the leaves”, said Professor Strano. The experiment is reportedly part of wider research involving engineering electronic components and systems into plants. The technology is called ‘plant nanobionics’ which is a process of giving plants new abilities. “This is a novel demonstration of how we have overcome the plant/human communication barrier”, he added.

Experiment useful for warning researchers about pollution and other environmental conditions

The purpose of the experiment was to detect explosives. However, scientists, including Strano, believe that the experiment could be used to alert researchers about pollution and other environmental conditions. Plants are said to be ideally suited to monitor ecological changes because of the large amount of data that they absorb from their surroundings. Professor Strano reportedly used nanoparticles to make plants into sensors for pollutants in the initial phases of the research. By changing the process of photosynthesis in the plants, Professor Strano made them capable of detecting nitric oxide, a pollutant caused by combustion.

According to Professor Strano, “Plants are very environmentally responsive. They know that there is going to be a drought long before we do. They can detect small changes in the properties of soil and water potential. If we tap into those chemical signalling pathways, there is wealth of information to access”.

Spinach can help make metal-air batteries

In addition to this, scientists have reportedly found that when spinach is converted into carbon nanosheets, it can function as a catalyst to help make metal-air batteries and fuel more efficient. Professor Shouzhong Zou, who led the research paper, said, “This work suggests that sustainable catalysts can be made for an oxygen reduction reaction from natural resources”. Metal-air batteries have more efficiency as compared to lithium-ion batteries that are commonly found in commercial products like smartphones. “The method we tested can produce highly active, carbob-based catalysts from spinach, which is a renewable biomass. In fact, we believe it outperforms commercial platinum catalysts in both activity and stability”, said Professor Zou.

The reason behind selecting spinach was that it has plenty of iron and nitrogen which are important elements in compounds that act as catalysts. In order make spinach suitable for the process, researchers turned it into nanosheets.",2021 has peaked already: Scientists have taught spinach to detect explosives and send emails,1,en

264,3383,"Let me admit, this was supposed to be a first impression. But, the PlayStation 5 is so addictive that I spent most of my free time over the past week glued to the screen, playing enough games to come up with the review. It took Sony a while to bring the PlayStation 5 to India and now that it’s here, this beast of a console is likely to rule for the next few years. It was in 2018 when we first started hearing about PS5, Sony confirmed the launch following year and the first glimpse was shown in early 2020.

By the end of that year, Sony PS5 had launched in most markets, except India. The timing couldn’t have been better we were in the middle of the pandemic, gaming was on a rise, people wanted more avenues to kill time and there was a need for more advanced gaming equipment. Sadly, the pandemic was for everyone. So, there was a shortage of supply and whatever was available, was lifted by the scalpers.

In India, the company faced different issues first with the trademark, then with the disrupted supply chains. The gaming enthusiasts got some relief on January 1 when Sony finally announced the India launch for February 2. As expected, the limited stock was sold out within minutes when the pre-orders began on January 12, 2021.

Despite Microsoft’s Xbox series arriving earlier, there is clearly high demand for Sony’s new-gen console. The temptation is so high that regular gamers have been selling hardware or saving for months so that they can spend Rs 50,000 on the PlayStation (disc variant). But, should you? Is it a genuine upgrade? What are the changes or improvements? Let’s look at all that in detail in our Sony PlayStation 5 review.

PlayStation 5 review: Most Futuristic Design

The Sony PlayStation 5 flaunts the most futuristic design on a gadget I have reviewed in long time. Usually, people buy gadgets and blend them with their living room. This one, will force you to make changes to the overall setting. The initial reveal and images put out by gamers around the world gave an idea that the PlayStation 5 is big. But, I wasn’t expecting it to be this huge and thick. The disc edition, which we have for the review, is 390mm x 104mm x 260mm (width x height x depth) in size.

This time you have the option to place the console both horizontally and vertically. When placed vertically, the PS5 looks like a gadget straight out of Star Trek, especially with that cool PlayStation logo on one corner. Imagine if Captain James Kirk actually had this thing on the USS Enterprise! His journey to explore new worlds would have ended with running around and completing missions within games.

Now, there are two things that you need to keep in mind when deciding the orientation of the device. First if placed vertically, there is a chance that you might end up covering a part of the television screen with the console, unless it is kept on the sides or on a table of comparatively lower height. In either case, the length of the HDMI cable can play the deciding role.

Second the process to switch between the two orientations is not seamless and requires some work. The PlayStation comes with a base stand that needs to be fixed under the machine in both cases. So, every time you plan to change the orientation, you will have to remove the screw from the stand, change its position, put the screw back and tighten it to make sure that the console doesn’t wobble.

The entire process can be tiresome and requires some delicacy to avoid damage. This isn’t easy to perform when you're handling a machine that weighs close to 4.5 kgs. Needless to say, the PlayStation 5 looks more glamorous when kept vertically. It features two LED strips one on each side which makes the console really stylish.

Sony has also switched to a ‘V’ shaped front from a more squarish PS4. I am not sure if it was a conscious decision to remind that this is the fifth-generation console or a mere coincidence but is surely a welcome move. The device comes with a sandwich-like design where the glossy-central part in black is covered by white plates with matte finish on either side.

White colour usually has the tendency of losing the charm earlier than most other options. In the six days, I have had this console at home, it seems capable of keeping dust away, but we will get a better idea with time.

PlayStation 5 review: Inside the Box

For now, the box remains pretty basic. It comes with the console, one DualSense Controller, a USB-A to type-C cable, power cable, manual, HDMI 2.1 cable, user manual and the base stand. The screw to fix the base stand is housed at the bottom of the stand itself. There are no games with the retail unit as of now. The Astro Playroom comes pre-installed, but you can expect Sony to launch bundles in future.

PlayStation 5 review: Advanced connectivity options

The PlayStation 5 comes with more and advanced connectivity options including USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports that Sony classify as a Superspeed USB with 10Gbps speed, an HDMI port that supports HDMI 2.1 to output 4K at 120Hz, and the 2-pin power port. On the front, you get USB-C Superspeed port and a High-Speed standard USB port.

There is of course the disc drive on the standard model and WiFi 6 for internet.

PlayStation 5 review: New UI

Sony has completely overhauled the UI of the PS5 which also reminds you how an upgrade should feel like, especially if it is coming after seven years of wait. The UI is now in HDR, neater and features trendy elements. The main menu now features two tabs Games and Media which ensure that your applications are separated and easy to find. For example, all the gaming titles like FIFA 21, Spider Man: Miles Morales and The Last of US II now appear under the Games tap while apps such as Netflix, Spotify and Prime Video can be accessed from the Media menu. In PS4, everything was listed in the Library folder.

The other major and welcoming change comes in the form of smaller icons, probably inspired by smartphone tiles. It helps achieve a neater look on the home page. So, now when you are on the game icon, the rest of the screen is filled with its artwork. This makes the screen look stunning even without applying a custom theme.

While the new UI focuses to declutter the home page, it also provides more information about each title than before. When you select a game, you can see stuff like Trophy progress, recent news on the game, or even YouTube streams related to it. Most of the times you are probably going to skip this information and just click the play button, but it is a handy update, nevertheless.

The bigger change comes on the in-game menu. Earlier, pressing the PS button would take you to the home screen. Now, it opens a small overlay at the bottom, giving you quick access to several features while staying in the game. These include notifications, volume level, battery status or the ability to stream from a platform. There is also an app switcher which lists down games and apps you have used. But, reboots them when switched.

There is also a hints system which basically helps you clear missions in a game by playing a picture-in-picture video. I have mixed feelings about this one. All of us have spent hours trying to clear tough missions, failing and learning on the way. This feature helps to solve that by giving clues, without having to Google for information. However, it might kill the experience of a game by reducing the struggle. At the end of the day, it depends on gamers what and how much they use this feature for.

PlayStation 5 review: Data Transfer

Transferring the data from your PS4 can also take some time and be frustrating. There are two ways to pull this off by uploading the files on cloud from PS4 and then downloading them on PS5 or, by connecting both the consoles to the same connection and transfer it through WiFi. The first is only available for PS Plus members while the latter takes time to complete. You also need to keep both the consoles running while the transfer happens.

PlayStation 5 review: Welcome to DualSense

The DualSense controller bundled with PS5 boasts of as futuristic design as the console itself. It makes PS4’s DualShock controller look silly in almost all departments. The overall design and button placement hasn’t changed much but it’s the dual tone finish and the haptic feedback that make all the difference. The textured back features icons on the controller. This has been done subtly and is only visible on closer look.

The controller is larger than before and features pointy sticks. The touch panel and rear triggers are slightly larger too which makes them easier to press. The home button still sits in between the sticks with the PS logo etched inside. The rest of the buttons are the same. Another major addition to the controller is a built-in mic which can be used for in-game conversations. There is also an option to mute it.

The inside is where major upgrades happen. The haptic feedback is new, inspiring and elevates your gaming experience to a new level. This can be experienced in the pre-installed Astro’s Playroom which is basically designed to take you through the features of the controller. It sends different vibrations as character moves across surfaces to give better experience of what’s happening on screen.

The feature prominently comes into effect in FIFA 21 when you pass the ball, engage in a tackle or score a goal. The controller vibrates differently in each case. Even in Miles Morales, a part of the controller vibrates whenever you get text as a smartphone would. As good as this works on the PS5-optimised games, results were slightly disappointing on the older PS4 games. For example, the vibrations seemed out of sync in Gran Turismo Sport. Hopefully, Sony is able to fix that.

The PlayStation 5 also brings an update to the triggers making them adaptive. This means the triggers offer variable tension, offering physical resistance depending on what you’re doing. What I noticed while playing FIFA was that the triggers become hard to press while defending but are freer when you are sprinting during attacks.

The enhanced vibrations and more immersive experience mean that the controller drains sooner than you would expect. I managed to get around seven hours of battery life from it which is similar to what you get on the DualShock controllers. The type-C USB cable helps charge the controller faster than before.

One mind baffling decision for me is that the PlayStation 5 is compatible with the DualShock controllers but only for PS4 games. This means your old controllers will still work with games like Gran Turismo, GTA 5 or God of War but not Miles Morales or FIFA 21. This will leave a lot of users divided on whether they should sell the older controllers or not.

The other thing is that as advanced as the DualSense controller is, it is still big. It is also more demanding with the adaptive triggers and adds to the fatigue. I have spent six to seven hours gaming on the PS4, but a couple of hours on the PS5 and your palms start asking for rest.

PlayStation 5 review: Quick and Better

There is no doubt that the PS5 is quicker, better and significantly faster than the PS4. It is powered by a custom eight-core AMD Zen 2 CPU and a custom AMD Radeon RDNA 2-based GPU. This is capable of providing 10.28 teraflops of power with 36 compute units running at 2.23GHz each. The system memory is 16GB. It also comes with solid-state drive (SSD) with 825GB. Out of this, some is already occupied by the system so you eventually get just 667.2GB for usage which might not be enough given the increasing size of games these days.

This is also one of the first challenges I faced. My PS4 game library was close to 800GB and all of that couldn’t be transferred to PS5. For example, The Last of US II itself takes over 100 GB on the console and there many others that demand at least 60 to 70GB of storage. So, in best case scenario, you can keep around seven to eight on the PS5 at once. It should force users to spend more external storage.

The PlayStation 5 is a lot faster than the previous-generation console, and this is a welcome move. There have been times when I would start a game and indulge in something else waiting for it load on the PS4. The new console entirely changes that. Games like Miles Morales and FIFA 21 loaded within seconds. Traveling to places through the map is also quicker on Miles Morales now. The navigation within the home screen and other menus feels slick too.

Among the games I tried, FIFA 21, Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Demon’s Soul were optimized for PlayStation 5 while WWE 2K20, Gran Turismo Sport, The Last of US II and Go of War were not. Also, I don’t own a 4K TV to make the best use of the graphics, but all the mentioned games looked amazing even on FHD. If you have the right TV, the PS5 supports up to 120fps and 4K HDR.

IMAGE SAMPLES

There is a new ray tracing mode as well which improves the lighting and delivers more details in the game. Titles like Miles Morales benefit heavily from this feature. The setting looks more natural than it did in the PS4 version, even though that was great too. There are more realistic reflections from lights, windows etc. In FIFA 21, the players look more realistic, the stadiums are very close to reality, the pitch seems wider, and the gameplay is certainly better finally making it possible to defend against AI.

The console also brings along a feature called ‘activities’ which lets users boot up games from a specific point, directly from the main menu. It comes really hand in mission-driven games that have checkpoints for saving progress.

The console also seems quitter than the PS4. The previous gen console would make sure to inform that it is running by making a sound in the background all the time. It would also throw a lot of heat. The PlayStation 5 surely does a better job in both these departments. It has a better cooling system. This could also be because the unit is new right now and a better picture will be presented over time.

PlayStation 5 review: Final Verdict

If you have been waiting and saving for the PlayStation 5 to launch in India, let me tell you it was worth it. That’s as simple as I can put it. This is how you design and build a next-gen gaming console which feels like a genuine upgrade and is worth the money. The PS5 is a major improvement when it comes to graphics, performance, haptic feedback and overall gaming experience. The DualSense controller is the biggest highlight of the entire package.

Some other year, with some other gadget, I might have advised you to wait for few months and pick a bundle that offers better value for money with an extra controller or game but the mismatch in demand and supply means that it is unlikely to happen anytime soon.

Yes, the size remains to be a topic of debate, but the design is breath-taking. There are other limitations such as lack of Dolby Vision or limited storage but consider the other things on offer, you can definitely consider spending Rs 50,000 on the disc variant. If not, then the digital edition also makes sense at Rs 40,000.",PlayStation 5 review: A significant upgrade that’s worth your money ,1,en
265,3385,"Four new Nokia 5G smartphones will be reportedly announced this year.

HMD Global is planning to launch affordable 5G Nokia smartphones in India. Company's Vice President Sanmeet Kochhar has revealed the brand's plan for 2021 in an interview. He acknowledged the Indian market as ""important"" and that it will be catered by ""customized"" Nokia devices.



In an interview to Financial Express, Sanmeet Kocchar said, ""We are looking at India as an important market and the first thing that we are going to do is look at products which are customized for the Indian market. Second is 5G, which is an important space that we have decided to play in, and we are looking at how we can launch more affordable 5G devices this year.""



Further, he said ""Our overall focus will be on communicating our differentiation from competitors. Our differentiation lies in terms of having a better, future-proof software. When you are buying a Nokia phone, you are getting software which is going to last for much longer and then you will not be forced to change your device (as frequently).""



For India becoming an export hub, the VP said ""India as a source for our exports is something that we are evaluating very closely. It is difficult to give a timeframe, but as I said, India is an important market for us, and we will continue to evaluate India, not only for our domestic consumption, but also from an export point of view.""

As per an earlier report, four new Nokia 5G smartphones will be announced this year. However, all these smartphones will not be launched altogether but two of them may be launched in the first half of 2021 while the two smartphones will be launched in the second half of 2021.

Meanwhile, Nokia 1.4 along with 6.3, 7.3 were recently reported to launch in Q1 or Q2 of 2021. Nokia 1.4 price of the Nokia 1.4 also leaked online. The Nokia 1.4 price in the UK is said to be £83 (around Rs 8,400/$114). To recall, its predecessor, the Nokia 1.3 launched at $99 in the US.



The phone will come with 1GB RAM and 16GB storage variant. The phone will also be made available in a Blue colour variant. Nokia 1.4 is expected to come in Blue and Grey colour options.

266,3386,"This story is being continuously updated…. New updates are being added at the bottom…..

NOTICE: We’ve compiled a comprehensive Android 11 update tracker for all the major OEMs and carriers, and will be updating it continuously.

Original story (published on April 23, 2020) follows:

Owing to its small smartphone repository, Japan’s Sony Mobile is usually among the first to get going with major Android OS updates. The company’s contributions to Google’s AOSP (more on this later) also play a huge part in the timely release of OS updates.

The stable Android 10, for instance, arrived in early December 2019, about three months after Google’s release. The company is pretty much done with updating its devices to the new OS (Xperia 10 and 10 Plus still wait) and now attention is set to turn to the Sony Android 11 update.

Google should bring out the public beta version in May, as usual. Since Sony was well represented in last year’s Android Q beta testing program, there is no doubt that one or two Xperia handsets will enter this year’s Android R beta program as well.

List of eligible devices

As noted, Sony doesn’t have a huge number of phones out there. This leaves only a handful of devices eligible for the big Sony Android 11 update.

Since the company’s software update policy is to provide at least two major OS updates, below are the devices we think Sony will upgrade to Android 11 OS:

– Sony Xperia 1 II

– Sony Xperia 10 II

– Sony Xperia 1

– Sony Xperia 5

– Sony Xperia 5 II

If you own any of the above Xperia handsets, rest assured that an update to Android 11 will be made available officially. As for those donning the likes of Xperia 10 and its Plus counterpart as well as Xperia L4, all of which have Pie preinstalled, don’t get your hopes too high.

Of course, Sony is likely to release a couple or so more phones before the end of the year and since they’ll possibly come running Android 10 out of the box, they should easily fit the bill for the official Sony Android 11 update.

NOTICE: We’ve compiled a comprehensive Android 11 update tracker for all the major OEMs and carriers, and will be updating it continuously.

Sony Android 11 update release date [Expected]

In 2012, then Technical Lead of Android Open Source Project at Google, Jean-Baptiste Queru, named Sony Mobile as one of the leading contributors to AOSP. At the time, he said the following about Sony:

Since Sony has been contributing a lot to the Android Open Source Project, they have fewer changes that they need to maintain on their own: those changes of theirs are already there when the source code is first released.

Source

It didn’t end there. In 2017, Google named Sony as the standout AOSP partner. Google said Sony contributed more than 30 feature enhancements and 250 bug fixes to Android Oreo. There is no reason to believe Sony is no longer a lead contributor to the upcoming Android 11 update.

That said, Jean-Baptiste Queru’s words come into play. That since Sony has early access to AOSP than most vendors, the company’s Android OS stable updates can be expected not long after Google makes the stable version available.

But when will Google release the stable Android 11 update? Probably in mid or late Q3 2020 (August or September), just like Android Pie and Android 10 more recently. Granted, the stable Sony Android 11 update may arrive in Q4 2020, you know, just like what happened with Android 10.

It’s worth noting that the information contained in this article isn’t official. Sony hasn’t revealed its Android 11 update plans, but when it does, we will update our story with the official details.

Original story (published on June 29, 2020) follows:

Android 11 is the new talk of the town, at least for those enthusiastic enough to keep an eye on every new release, beta or stable. Naturally, many Xiaomi fans are eager to know if and when their devices will receive Android 11 update.

Google announced the first developer preview version in March and has since released the first public beta version. Unlike the former, the latter can be used by anyone willing to test the waters ahead of the stable release probably beginning September.

But being an unfinished version of the OS, access to this firmware is still limited to a certain group of phones from various device vendors. Google, OnePlus, OPPO, Vivo, and Xiaomi already have devices in the program and in this article, we keep track of the latter’s progress, be it beta or stable releases.

Last year, Xiaomi enrolled the Mi 9 and Mi MIX 3 5G into the Android Q beta program. This year, more devices are taking part in the early beta testing program, meaning they already have access to the latest Android 11 Beta 1.

For an idea of Xiaomi devices that are likely to be upgraded to Android 11, probably beginning later this year, check out this article.

New updates will be added in the section below and Xiaomi Android 11 update tracker will follow after this section

Update 51 (November 16, 2020)

IST: 07:25 pm: Xiaomi seems to have released the stable Android 11 update with MIUI 12 version 12.2.2.0.RJBCNXM on top to Mi 10 units in China. The update was previously released last week but was rolled back, possibly due to bugs. More details here.

IST: 12:45 pm: Apparently, Xiaomi is “working hard” to release the Android 11 update for the Redmi Note 8 soon, according to a support representative for the company. Of course, support reps don’t have a flawless track record and thus the information should be taken with a grain of salt.

271,3392,"The 5G Economy will Spur Massive GDP and Job Growth Across the US

Copyright 2021 PR Newswire. All Rights Reserved2021-02-02

WASHINGTON, Feb. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- 5G networks could create about 4.5 million jobs in the US and add roughly $1.5 trillion to the country's GDP, according to a new report from Boston Consulting Group (BCG), commissioned by CTIA, the wireless industry association.

BCG's analysis shows that 5G will contribute to US GDP and employment growth by enabling of innovation that will transform all sectors of America's economy across cities and communities of all sizes.

""Our analysis shows that the 5G economy's impact will be broad and deep, unlocking significant benefits across the US and enabling new use cases across all industries, including health care, education, and agriculture,"" said Enrique Duarte Melo, a BCG managing director and senior partner and lead author of this report. ""The GDP growth and job creation that America's 5G networks are beginning to unlock will be instrumental in jump-starting the country's economic recovery.""

BCG's research suggests that three industries, in particular, will benefit from these 5G use cases:

Information services, which will see job growth of 205,000 and contribute $217 billion to GDP

to GDP Manufacturing, which will see a boost of 380,000 jobs and contribute $165 billion to GDP

to GDP Health care, which will see 341,000 new jobs and contribute $104 billion to GDP

""BCG's study confirms the significant benefits of the 5G economy, today and for years to come,"" said Meredith Attwell Baker, CTIA President and CEO. ""With three nationwide 5G networks launched and 5G smartphones hitting the market, America's wireless industry is building the foundation for our country's economic recovery.""

To bring these benefits to fruition, state, local, and federal governments must work to keep 5G's rollout on track. Delays in network infrastructure build-out or in making more licensed spectrum available would carry significant opportunity costs, according to BCG's analysis. At a national level, every six-month delay in 5G network deployment could, on average, mean missing out on $25 billion of the potential 5G benefits from 2020 through 2030.

Verizon uses the name ""5G Ultra Wideband"" for the service. Qualcomm is currently the dominant supplier of chips to take advantage of the millimeter wave technology, with its chips used in the U.S. versions of Apple Inc's iPhone 12.

Original story (published on June 30, 2020) follows:

OPPO isn’t the most prolific when it comes to rolling out timely Android OS updates. Matter of fact, the Chinese vendor is still issuing Android 10 beta updates to some of its devices in Q2 2020, yet talks of Android 11 are already doing rounds on the interwebs.

Google has already released the first public beta version of Android 11 for Pixel users and is slowly spreading this love to non-Pixel devices, but not everyone is aboard this ship.

Just like last year, though, OPPO is taking part in this year’s Android R beta testing program. The standard OPPO Reno was the only device taking part in beta testing Android Q. This year, the number has doubled, at least at the time of this writing.

Earlier this month, OPPO revealed that the Find X2 and Find X2 Pro will be part of the beta team testing Android 11. About two weeks later, the devices indeed picked up their first Android 11 beta update.

The expectation is that the stable OPPO Android 11 update will arrive with ColorOS 8 on top. But for now, those making the switch to Android 11 beta on the Find X2 and Find X2 Pro are getting ColorOS 7.2 on top of AOSP.

Owing to the sheer amount of customizations that OPPO will be adding on top of Android 11 AOSP, we won’t be surprised if the stable version begins rolling out late this year or even in early 2021.

But as always, we will keep an eye on the developments and update the table below with the latest news as and when any OPPO device picks up the beta or stable Android 11 update.

New updates will be added in the section below and the tracker follows after that

Back in 2014, Microsoft launched a scanning app exclusively for Windows Phone called Office Lens. A year later, it branched out to offer Android and iOS versions. Now it's getting a name change along with some new features.

Saumitra Agarwal, Senior PM Lead for Lens at Microsoft, announced on the Microsoft 365 Blog that Office Lens will now be known as Microsoft Lens. The icon has also been updated to bring it in line with what we're used to seeing for the Office apps. Agarwal describes the change as a ""new identity"" for the mobile scanning app, but the main reason users will want the latest version is because of the new features it introduces.

New intelligent actions added to the camera include Image to Text, Image to Table, Image to Contact, Immersive Reader, and QR Code Scan. Agarwal also explains that, ""We are releasing an improved scan experience allowing you to re-order pages, re-edit scanned PDFs, apply a filter to all images in the document, scan up to 100 pages as images or PDFs, easily switch between local and cloud locations while saving PDF, along with an easy way to identify local and cloud files. ""

The new features aren't quite ready for release, but Agarwal says Android will get the updated version first followed by iOS ""in the coming months."" The Microsoft 365 mobile apps also have Lens integrated, so the new features will also be available to Office users from their smartphone or tablet.",Office Lens Gets a New Name and Features,1,en

Original story (published on June 18, 2020) follows:

Xiaomi announced MIUI 12 update in China on April 27, 2020. The beta testing program kicked off almost immediately, but as expected, only Chinese users were allowed into the setup.

It took Xiaomi about a month to prepare the global MIUI 12 version, with the first devices getting a taste of the new skin in late May, albeit in beta. The official announcement happened a week earlier on May 19, 2020.

As of this writing (June 18), a handful of Xiaomi devices have picked up the stable MIUI 12 update in China. The rollout is expected to expand to more regions and devices soon and in fact, some in Europe and India already have access to the pre-release version.

Ahead of the wider rollout, we have come up with this page to keep track of all Xiaomi, Redmi and Poco devices that have received the stable MIUI 12 update for all region-based ROMs, that is, China (CN), Global (MI), Europe (EU), India (IN), Indonesia (ID), and Russia (RU).

The first wave of the stable MIUI 12 updates outside China begins in June. The target is the Mi 9, Mi 9T, Mi 9T Pro, Redmi K20, and Redmi K20 Pro, with the rest of the devices crammed into phase 2 of the rollout scheduled to begin in July.

While some devices will be receiving their MIUI 12 treats alongside new OS upgrades, others will stick to the same base OS as before. On the brighter side, MIUI 12 has volumes of new features to keep you glued to Xiaomi, so it shouldn’t be boring at all.

Klaus Schwab

Today, we are all surrounded by AI so extensively that we don’t even realize its presence around us. Your smartphone is the biggest example of AI, that you use all through the day. It is AI that enables you to shoot a video in portrait mode or switch it to landscape mode.

It is AI that enables you to ask Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant to make a call, text for you, and dim the lights for you. Now, when you book a gas refill or even your movie tickets, it feels like you are chatting to some agent. Is it so? No, it’s actually a chatbot interacting with you, and the credit goes to Artificial Intelligence.

There are numerous examples of AI that we come across in our daily life, as in recommendation engines on Facebook and shopping portals, music and movie recommendations on Netflix, etc. With such fascinating applications, there is increased interest among professionals to learn AI. In fact, a lot of training providers have started offering AI courses to help them step into this field.

While we are enjoying the amenities provided to us by Artificial Intelligence, there are some special considerations for which AI has been put into scrutiny by the public and scientists.

While AI is thought of as killing jobs across the globe, it should be understood that it is killing a category of jobs, along with producing a new category of jobs that require skilled and trained professionals in Artificial Intelligence.

What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence is a term that refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans, generally mimicking human behavior. When a machine exhibits some traits related to human behavior it is termed artificially intelligent.

The absolute characteristic of AI is the ability of a machine to rationalize and take such decisions that result in achieving the specified goal. The goals of artificial intelligence include reasoning, learning, and perception.

Today, AI is being used in almost every sector like gaming, healthcare, finance, retail, social media, entertainment, travel and navigation, smart home devices, security and surveillance, and more. AI is continuously evolving to profit different industries, there are some issues that are to be considered, and hence AI systems should be developed keeping in mind the ethics of Artificial Intelligence.

Let us explore some important ethics of Artificial Intelligence.

Ethics in Artificial Intelligence

There are some questions that come into people’s minds around the world.

Are AI systems really secure?

Will self-driving cars drive us around?

Will AI robots do our laundry?

Will AI systems raise our kids?

And the most important one,

Will AI replace human workers and kill the jobs?

These are some questions that make people doubt AI systems. So, keeping aside the functional capabilities of AI systems, it makes sense to consider the ethics behind building such robust and potentially life-consequential systems.

Will Artificial Intelligence replace human workers?

Since AI-enabled systems have replaced human labor across a wide range of industries, this has made an immediate concern for many that AI is killing jobs. But, like every wave of technology has swept a category of jobs, AI is also responsible for eliminating a category of jobs, thereby producing a new category. So employment is not destroyed, but it is shifted from one category to another. Now, companies are looking for trained and skilled AI professionals in order to adapt and implement AI techniques in their organizations.

Liability for self-driving cars

Since their development, self-driving cars have been controversial as their machines are so designed that they invoke the lowest risk and least casualties. They are simulated and provided with a scenario of an accident; they choose an option that causes the least damage.

Currently, self-driving cars need a driver to oversee the actions, being semi-autonomous. Hence these cars, while being convenient, are not an appropriate substitute.

Biases in AI systems

AI is widely used today in facial and voice recognition systems. But it is found that there are biases in the algorithm developed for performing the recognition. It recognized more efficiently the male candidates than females.

Amazon discontinued the use of AI hiring and recruitment systems because it preferred male candidates to female ones.

There are many ways in which bias can creep into the systems, as existing bias, technical bias, and emergent bias.

Transparency, accountability, and open-source

In an era that is AI-enabled, it is assumed that everyone and everything will know about everyone else. This clearly implies that everyone else knows what you are, what you want, and what you are doing. Maintaining transparency in the AI-enables system is crucial.

To develop open-source AI beneficial to humans, a non-profit company is established by Elon Musk and Sam Altman. But, creating open-source code doesn’t make it comprehensive, thus making code non-transparent.

It is an ethical obligation of companies to regulate transparency, and through it, human accountability.

A threat to human dignity

There are some positions that should not be replaced by AI systems, as in,

A therapist

A nurse for elderly citizens,

A judge,

A soldier,

A police officer,

A customer service representative,

A sales representative, and more.

This is because we expect authentic feelings of empathy from professionals in these positions.

AI systems cannot simulate empathy and thus pose a threat to human dignity. It is also an ethic to be considered to maintain the dignity of mankind.

The weaponization of Artificial Intelligence

The increase in the weaponization of artificial intelligence appears to be a destabilizing development. It has brought about complex security challenges for the nations as well as the decision-makers for the future of humanity. Today, the weaponization of AI is causing great fear because a weapon system activated across CGS(cyberspace, geospace, and space) can engage in human and non-human targets without being guided by human operators. It is revolutionizing warfare. So it is crucial to visualize how the algorithmic war of the future looks like.

The other ethics to be considered while developing AI-enabled systems are machine ethics, singularity, robot ethics, and more.

While manufacturers can easily replace human labor, and industries can automate certain jobs, there are ethics that are to be followed while developing AI systems. So, there will always be a need for a category of professionals who can master the concepts and provide transparency, privacy, security, and still effective systems that serve humanity.",Important Ethics in Artificial Intelligence,1,en

284,3410,"A strong commitment to research and innovation and the allocation of Rs 50,000 crore over a period of five years through the National Research Fund is probably the most talked-about announcement in academic circles about this year’s Union Budget.

Hailing it as a gamechanger move, educationists hope that given Pune’s reputation for being a city of top-notch academics and research institutions, it would prove beneficial to boosting research.

“For the last few years now, there has been a strong focus on research and innovation. Pune is one of the six cities where a knowledge centre was created directly under the PMO where top universities, research institutions, and the industry is working together to promote research. Given the infrastructure, research culture, and institutions that we have, we hope to be one of beneficiaries of this renewed focus,” said Dr Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor, SPPU.

Dr Dishan Kamdar, vice-chancellor, Flame University termed the government’s decision to allocate Rs.50,000 crores over five years as a shot in the arm for the country’s research ecosystem. “Lack of adequate funding has been a constraint for several higher education institutions and this support will enable the institutions and the faculty to produce high quality, rigorous research output,” he said.

Stating that the entire budget has been aligned to the roll-out of the new National Education Policy, Dr Vidya Yeravdekar, pro-chancellor of Symbiosis International (Deemed) University said allocating Rs 50,000 crores towards NRF would give Indian universities the money to invest in doing research which was lacking so far.

Another high point of the budget was the higher education commission, an umbrella body for accreditation, regulation, funding and more. “The regulatory framework in Higher Education sector was stifling. We welcome the commission for which legislation will come out this year, as all regulatory bodies will be merged into this one council,” said Yeravdekar.

Educationists said the focus on skill development and practical learning, especially the amendment of the National Apprenticeship Programme is also welcome.

“At the local level, we have started focussing on it already. Coming up with various skill-related courses, tying up with industry to offer internships. Allocating Rs 3000 crore for the apprentice training scheme is a considerable commitment, which will ensure that skilling of students get priority, enabling them to be future-ready. A partnership with the UAE to benchmark skill qualifications and certifications is a great move,” said Karmalkar.

As far as the school education sector goes, strengthening of 15000 schools to act as mentor to other schools, starting 100 Sainik schools, to an evolved pedagogical approach for students in K12 sector moving from rote to conceptual learning, were some of the highlights.

“The government’s decision to strengthen school education across 15,000 schools despite the hurdles owing to the COVID-19 pandemic shows clear intent. However, the rollout and implementation across all states should be done within a couple of years to bring parity for students to access education across the country. The participation of the private sector and NGOs in managing and operating schools will be an enabler in providing a modern and high-quality framework for education and boost the sector to engage with many more projects under the public-private partnership model,” said Rustom Kerawalla, Chairman, Ampersand Group.

However, educationists in the K12 sector, opined much was left out. “As private players in the K12 education sector, we had one of the toughest years. We were relying heavily on the budget announcement in terms of rebates through tax concession or relaxation in terms of the GST. However, there was no such mention with regards to any of these. It has therefore put us in a difficult place, financially, forcing us to rely heavily on the fees paid by the parents. The government needs to take notice of private players too, and this budget has largely ignored us,” said Dr Aanieetaa Vaissnava, principal of Orchids The International School in Nigdi.","Higher education institutes welcome Budget’s focus on research, internship; K12 section felt leftout",1,en
285,3411,"Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek has released a new 5G chip aimed at helping it gain market share in the United States.

MediaTek is one of the few suppliers of modem chips that help devices such as smart phones connect to cellular data networks. The company supplies chips to phone makers such as Xiaomi and LG Electronics, among others.

To date, though, MediaTek’s 5G chips have been compatible with only the “sub-6” variant of 5G networks, which is the variety being widely used in countries such as China.

MediaTek’s modem chip announced on Monday, called the M80, will also support millimeter-wave technology, which is being used by U.S. carriers such as Verizon Communications.

Verizon uses the name “5G Ultra Wideband” for the service. Qualcomm is currently the dominant supplier of chips to take advantage of the millimeter wave technology, with its chips used in the U.S. versions of Apple’s iPhone 12 5G smartphone.

Finbarr Moynihan, general manager of international corporate sales, said that MediaTek hopes to win more contracts to supply chips for U.S. models, Reuters reported.

“It’s a very different market, in terms of the operator landscape and the technology requirements, but we’ve been very pleased to some solid progress in our volume and market share” with handset makers such as Samsung and LG, Finbarr Moynihan said.

“As 5G rollouts accelerate, mmWave is becoming increasingly important, especially in the U.S. MediaTek’s new 5G modem integrates support for both sub-6 GHz and mmWave networks to address this opportunity and give device makers more flexibility,” said JC Hsu, corporate vice president of MediaTek’s Wireless Communications Business Unit.

MediaTek’s 5G modems are suitable for advanced devices, including smartphones, PCs, Mi-Fi hotspots, broadband customer premise equipment (CPE), industrial IoT applications and more.

MediaTek’s first generation 5G modem, the M70, is built into MediaTek’s Dimensity chipsets for 5G smartphones.

The company’s 5G portfolio also includes the MediaTek T700, which will power 5G PCs set to hit the market in 2021, along with MediaTek’s T750 chipset for 5G fixed wireless access routers (FWA) and mobile hotspot devices.",MediaTek unveils 5G chip aimed at gaining US market share,1,en

289,3417,"Budget 2021 could result in price hike for the smartphones and other components as tax rates on some smartphone components rise.

India will now focus more on local smartphone manufacturing business as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the removal of a few custom duty exemptions on importing parts of mobile chargers and sub-parts of mobile phones.

The announcement also included the custom duty on some parts of the handsets moving towards 2.5 percent from 0 percent. Some of the new changes will be effective starting 2nd February while the remaining will come into effect starting April 1st.

These changes mean that we could soon witness a price hike in smartphone prices in India, reason being manufacturers passing the load onto the customer.

""Domestic manufacturing has grown rapidly, we are now exporting items like mobiles and chargers. For greater domestic value addition, we are withdrawing a few exemptions on parts of chargers, and sub-parts of mobiles. Further, some parts of mobiles will move from 'nil' grade to a moderate 2.5 percent"", said Sitharaman.

Mobile parts including Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA), Camera Module, and Connectors will have 2.5 percent tax get levied on them. Parts and sub-parts for manufacturing the battery and the battery pack will face a similar tax rate levied. These new rates will be effective from 1st April 2021.

Starting February 2nd, rates on import of PCBA and moulded plastic for manufacturing of charger or adapter will face an increase from 10 percent to 15 percent, along with all the other parts required that are required for assembling a mobile charger will have a custom duty levied of about 10 percent.

If the smartphone manufacturers decide to carry forward this tax burden onto the customer, it will mean a price hike for the final price of the smartphone and the chargers. If the manufacturers decide to switch to locally manufactured components, it might help them reduce the impact of increased tax rates.

""There is a focus on electronics manufacturing and increase in duty for certain sub-components is a push to localise some of these components. This might increase prices for term short term or see a very modest increase as bulk of these sub-components already have local suppliers like for Camera modules, PCBAs, chargers, connectors etc"", as per Prachir Singh, Senior Research Analyst, Counterpoint Research.

""Like recent PLI scheme for telecom equipment manufacturing, Consumer IoT, routers and switches, customer premise equipment, next-generation radio access networks and all. There is a big scope to localise value addition in these areas as well"", she adds.

The phone comes in Diamond Glass and the matte finish at rear side makes it very smooth to grip. ZERO 8i also features a multifunctional side-mounted fingerprint sensor. In the first look, it impresses you with its classy design. However, the phone is slightly heavy as it’s total weight is 210.5 gms.

Display

The phone has 90Hz refresh rate which is quite common in all the smartphones under this budget. Also, it has a 180Hz touch sampling rate so it will provide a faster screen response and a smooth usage experience. You are also getting 480 NITS brightness in the display which is good for outdoor display.

Camera

First of all the camera is designed in diamond shape which truly intensifies its looks. The Infinix Zero 8i comes equipped with a 48MP AI Quad rear camera with an 8MP Ultra-Wide angle lens, a 2MP depth sensor and an AI lens. The rear camera quality is quite impressive so it will be a perfect treat for photography lovers. We were very happy to see the super slow motion and 4K videos feature in this phone. There are some other modes as well like Eye Tracking mode, Macro Mode, Document Mode and Pro mode. Usually when you zoom into the picture, the pixels get distorted and picture quality degrades further. But in this phone, picture quality & it’s complete detailing remains intact.

On either side, the selfie camera looks promising as it is a 16MP + 8MP Dual selfie camera. The quality of selfie camera is good. The brightness and depth of the selfies is quite good. The best thing about Zero 8i’s selfie camera is wide angle shot.

Performance

Infinix Zero 8i is equipped with MediaTek Helio G90T 64 bit Octa-core processor. The processor is indeed very powerful and we expect such kind of processor under this budget. Moreover, the smartphone is backed by ARM Mali – G70 GPU, which is super clocked at 800GHz and MediaTek HyperEngine game technology. The specifications are good to allow gaming enthusiasts to play heavy games like Call Of Duty, Free Fire or Asphalt Legends etc without excessive power consumption. We played some of the games like Call of Duty and some racing games to evaluate its overall performance. The gameplay was very smooth and uninterrupted. Also phone doesn’t heat much as the smartphone has Multi-Dimensional Liquid Cooling Technology. Zero 8i operates on Android 10 with the latest XOS 7 skin. It has a 4,500 mAh battery backed by an ultra-Power Marathon technology that optimises the power used by the apps and thereby increases 25% battery backup.

Infinix Zero 8i comes only in the 8GB+128GB storage variant and priced at Rs. 14,999/-. The storage is expandable upto 256GB with the help of microSD card. Comes with two color options, black diamond and silver diamond and available on Flipkart.

Telecom Today Verdict Infinix Zero 8i has all the features that make it an ideal phone under 15K. During our review, we tested this phone on several parameters and then evaluated whether it is worth buying or not. Its camera quality seems to be perfect and gaming is up to the mark. Infinix has given it powerful hardware for smooth gaming so it doesn’t disappoint the gaming enthusiasts. We find this phone one of the best smartphones under this budget.

293,3424,"Nokia might be preparing for the Nokia 2.4 successor soon, considering that new smartphone has cleared the Bluetooth SIG certification. The device in question is speculated to be the Nokia 2.4’s next version (could be Nokia 2.5), which has recently been availed green light from Bluetooth SIG. The specs of this upcoming device remains a mystery for now, except its hardware existence is now verified.

Nokia 2.4 Successor Gets Bluetooth SIG Certified

The so-called Nokia 2.4 successor might pack a MediaTek chipset, and may come with Bluetooth 5.0 and LTE support. This means that the device will lack 5G support. Apart from this, Bluetooth SIG certification reveals that the upcoming smartphone will come with model number as T99652AA1. This is more or less similar to the Nokia 2.4’s T99651AA1 model number. The Nokia 2.4 was certified by Bluetooth SIG in August, and the device went official on November 26. If Nokia takes the same time as it took for certification and launching of the Nokia 2.4, the launch of this newly certified device could happen in March or April. Other specs like the design, display size, camera resolutions, and battery capacity are not out the moment.

In a piece of related news, yet another Nokia smartphone, possibly the Nokia 1.4 with model number Nokia TA-1322, TA-1323, and TA-1329 have cleared certification from Wi-Fi Alliance. The Nokia 1.4 is expected to feature a 6.51-inch display with HD+ resolution, packing an unspecified 1.3GHz quad-core processor. This entry-level device is said to come with 1GB RAM and 16GB internal storage. It might sport an 8MP+2MP dual cameras and 5MP front camera for the selfies and video calling. It might be fueled with a big 4000mAh battery.

There’s even another news that Nokia is planning to launch a slew of affordable 5G Nokia-branded handsets in India this year. This was revealed by HMD Global’s Vice President Sanmeet Kochhar in an interview to Financial Express Online. He also mentioned that HMD Global focus will on providing better, future-proof software to its customers. He also said that “India as a source for our exports is something that we are evaluating very closely. It is difficult to give a timeframe, but as I said, India is an important market for us, and we will continue to evaluate India, not only for our domestic consumption but also from an export point of view.”

294,3425,"This story is being continuously updated…. New updates are being added at the bottom…..

Original story (from Nov 17) follows:

Samsung’s One UI 3.0 skin over Android 11 is yet to be released to the public as a stable update. Unsurprisingly, Samsung didn’t even participate in the Android 11 beta program alongside Google.

Therefore, Samsung Galaxy S20 series and Samsung Galaxy Note 20 series users only got a chance to try out the One UI 3.0 beta based on Android 11 after Google rolled out the stable update.

The One UI 3.0 beta program first kick-started for the Samsung Galaxy S20 lineup in its home country — South Korea — and then expanded to other regions including Germany and the USA.

At present, Samsung has rolled out six One UI 3.0 beta updates with the latest bearing the software version number ZTKA.

That being said, you can check out our dedicated tracker to know more about the release of One UI 3.0 for all eligible Samsung smartphones.

Now, even though One UI 3.0 is fresh on the block, it’s likely that we will get to see Samsung debut its One UI 3.1 skin based on Android 11 within the next couple of months.

More precisely, we may get to see the new skin on January 14, 2021, according to Jon Prosser, who has claimed that Samsung would be announcing the Galaxy S21 series on that date.

Now, if you’re wondering what does the announcement of the Samsung Galaxy S21 series has to do with the One UI 3.1 skin, then hear us out.

Samsung has a habit of launching new flagships with a slightly newer version of its in-house skin.

Take for example the Samsung Galaxy S9 series, both devices got the update to One UI 1.0. Then, when Samsung launched the Galaxy S10 series, it came pre-loaded with One UI 1.1.

Similarly, the South Korean giant released the Galaxy S20 series with the One UI 2.1 skin and the Galaxy Note 20 series came with One UI 2.5 out-of-the-box.

So unless Samsung decides to switch up the existing trend we just highlighted, it’s more than likely that the Samsung Galaxy S21 series will come with the One UI 3.1 skin pre-installed.

This means that we will get three smartphones — the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+, and Galaxy S21 Ultra — running One UI 3.1 at the start of next year.

Given that we’re still a couple of months away from the expected launch, there’s little to no information regarding what to expect from Samsung’s upcoming skin.

However, it’s likely that Samsung would refine some of the existing features and maybe even added a few new ones to improve the user experience.

Current features such as the Moon mode and Night mode might see some improvements with the new skin as highlighted here.

Furthermore, you can expect to see certain Samsung Galaxy S21 series features being brought over to older Samsung phones such as the Galaxy S20 and Note 20 series with the One UI 3.1 update.

But it’s worth noting that not all features that Samsung may introduce with the Galaxy S21 lineup would be available on older smartphones due to hardware limitations.

Of course, do not expect to see any major UI overhauls since the update to One UI 3.1 from One UI 3.0 isn’t a major one.

As for which devices will get the One UI 3.1 update, we expect that Samsung will release the upcoming skin for all smartphones that are eligible for the Android-11 based One UI 3.0 update.

Nevertheless, most information we have about the One UI 3.1 update is based on speculations and past trends and thus should not be treated as official claims.

As usual, we will continue scanning for any developments regarding the One UI 3.1 skin from Samsung and will post an update once new details emerge.

Here’s a translation of the message in the screengrab:

Night mode is not applied when a disaster message is received. Hello? This phenomenon will be corrected by Google at the end of December, and after the official release of One UI 3.1, we will proceed with additional S / W improvement.

LG has released the stable update of Android 11 for its LG Velvet 5G smartphone. The company rolled out Android 11 beta built for the smartphone last month and now stable Android 11 update has been rolled out in South Korea.



The stable Android 11 update for LG Velvet 5G has software version G900N2C and it is around 2.2GB in size. It is being rolled out in batches. As of now, the update is limited to South Korean units with model LM-G900N, but is likely to be rolled to other units as well. LG Velvet was launched with Android 10 with Velvet UI on top of it in October last year in India. However, the Indian variant of the smartphone does not come with 5G connectivity.



The Android 11 It update brings notification history, priority chat function, and chat bubbles features. It is also likely that the update will also bring the January 2021 Android security patch to the LG Velvet 5G.

297,3428,"The General Manager of Redmi, Lu Weibing’s recent post on Weibo hints that more phones from the Chinese smartphone maker this year will have a primary sensor of more than 100MP. In the same post, Weibing questioned other smartphone makers as well for not including ToF (Time of Flight) sensors that were earlier promoted by them. The first Redmi phone to feature the 108MP was Redmi Note 9 Pro 5G which was launched in China.

The new announcement indicates that the Redmi K40 series may come equipped with the large sensor. The Redmi K40 is confirmed to release before the spring festival in China. However, in the teaser photo of the device, the camera module looks similar to its predecessor.

As per the leaks, Redmi K40 is expected to come with the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 775G processor which is a 5nm chipset. The chipset is expected to support up to 12GB of RAM, 120Hz refresh rate and UFS 3.1 storage. The phone is also expected to feature an OLED display with a punch-hole design instead of an LCD display.

So far, no Redmi phone in India has a camera sensor in excess of 100MP. In 2021, Xiaomi’s first launch in India was Mi 10i which is a rebranded version of Redmi Note 9 Pro 5G in China.

The Mi 10i featured a 108MP ISOCELL HM2 sensor by Samsung. The company says the 0.7µm pixels coupled with ISOCELL Plus and Smart-ISO technologies are able to provide a wide dynamic range and optimal exposure. It also uses 9-in-1pixel binning technology which helps in better performance in low-light conditions.","More Redmi phones may feature 108MP sensor, hints General Manager Lu Weibing",1,en
298,3429,"Last year, Samsung stunned all smartphone geeks in India by launching the Galaxy S10 Lite – a watered-down edition of the Galaxy S10 with the more capable Snapdragon 855 Plus chip, a bigger battery, and (most importantly) a cheaper price tag. It was a hit recipe but Samsung followed it up with the Galaxy S20 FE, which did not impress critics as much as its international 5G variant, courtesy of its Exynos 990 chipset. Samsung now possibly wants to fix that with the Galaxy S20 FE 5G. Also Read - Samsung 100-day trial for Galaxy Z Fold 2, Galaxy Z Flip 5G floated for customers

A report from Pricebaba spotted the Galaxy S20 FE 5G’s support page on Samsung India’s website. The phone was also spotted getting the latest BIS certification, thereby hinting at an imminent launch. The 5G variant is the same as the international variant that used the Snapdragon 865 chip instead of the Exynos 990.

Galaxy S20 FE 5G coming to India

While the Galaxy S20 FE that India got was a good phone overall, it struggled with the inferior Exynos 990 chipset. We reviewed the phone at BGR India and found the phone overheating as well as struggling with resource-intensive games at times. The phone also lacked support for 5G. The international variant, however, got the Snapdragon 865 variant that solved all the issues of the Exynos variant.

In India, the Galaxy S20 FE 5G could retain 95 percent of the same features as the 4G variant, except for the chipset. That means you are going to get the same plastic unibody design with the five-color palette. The display remains the same at 6.5-inches and will offer the same Super AMOLED experience with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. The Snapdragon 865 could help with improved battery life, better image processing, and faster performance (obviously).

What remains to be seen is how Samsung prices the Galaxy S20 FE 5G in India, given that the 4G variant already sells at a fairly high price of Rs 49,999. It is possible that Samsung could discontinue the Exynos variant and bring the 5G version at a similar price. Samsung could also dip the price of the 4G variant and bring the Snapdragon version at a higher price, or vice versa.

Currently, the only Samsung phone in India to use the Snapdragon 865 chip is the ultra-premium Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G. The current-gen Galaxy S21 series is using the Exynos 2100 chipset series.","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G India launch soon: Price, specs and more",1,en

303,3434,"Samsung has been taking on Apple head-on for the last decade with the Galaxy S series. Over the years, the Galaxy brand has become a powerful one which has sold more than 2 billion phones. But in recent years, Samsung has been shown up by just not only Apple but other Android brethren. The Galaxy S20 Ultra was an audacious effort to pull Samsung ahead of the pack, but it backfired. The S20 Ultra had a litany of issues -- from its disgraceful camera to overcooked processor to its hideous design. The Galaxy S21 Ultra, thankfully, redeems all these mistakes in one swift move making it the most complete Android smartphone I have tested in a year. Sure, there will be others that may one-up Samsung, but right now, it is the king of the hill. The bigger thing is that it is a phone that is likely to remain attractive no matter what gains the competition comes up with.

The first thing one notices is the slender packaging which is now thanks to the removal of the power brick and the earphones. This was telegraphed by Apple months ago with its strategy to remove these ""so-called"" add-ons in the name of the environment. Samsung like a spastic kid decided to troll Apple only to do the very same thing unapologetically like a megalomaniac. I don’t like it especially because Samsung provided some lovely AKG earphones. But aside from this, you’re looking at a massive phone which Samsung has finessed almost perfectly to un-do the evils of the hideous monstrosity that the S20 Ultra was.

Dressed in a slick and stealthy phantom black and a delectable camera bump which seamlessly swoops in the frame of the phone and leaving the seemingly chiselled for posterity, the S21 Ultra is a looker. It also has this supple matte finish which reminds me of the iPhone 7 though it comes without the ills of oxidisation as there is Gorilla Glass victus on the back providing class-leading sturdiness and much-needed resistance to smudges. The sides have a polished finish typified by an aluminium frame which makes the phone pretty grippy thanks to the contrast between matte on the back and the polish on the side.

You flip the phone and there is the massive 6.8-inch dynamic AMOLED panel which is pretty much the best mobile display on the planet. It gets obnoxiously bright at 1500 nits, it has sublime colours, it supports HDR formats which make it a delight to Netflix and chill on and it has 120Hz refresh rate at a Quad HD resolution with it having the ability to dynamically ramp down. This phone is using a new kind of screen which is also 15 per cent more power efficient.

The display is not the only factor which contributes to the impressive battery life of the S21 Ultra - the efficiency of the new Exynos 2100 chip, the new software optimizations and the impressively massive size (5,000mAh) of the battery are important elements as well. Exynos redeems its reputation after the shockingly poor 990 chip in 2020. The Exynos 2100 is beastly thanks to the use of the stock ARM Cortex X1 based architecture coupled with a new 5nm process which ensures this phone isn't just as fast as Max Verstappen but also delivers consistent 2-day battery life for even when the device is used extremely.

While you don't get a charging brick, it does support decent charging speeds of 25 watts. This is admittedly not the best in class but it is at least better than the iPhone. You also get wireless charging at 15 watts and reverse wireless charging which is incredibly handy.

But for most this phone is going to be about raw power and that Exynos chip delivers in all kinds of situations be it hectic multitasking or gaming or general fluid navigation of the user interface. This time around I don't foresee a massive discrepancy in the performance of the phone when compared to phones that are powered by the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip. You also get tons of horsepower in the form of UFS 3.1 memory, 256GB of it when paired in tandem with 12GB of DDR5 RAM. This phone is pretty much the fastest Android phone I've tested and I don't see it losing that mantle overnight with some other phones coming as the processor can hold its own against the Qualcomm based competition.

The presence of an integrated 5G modem also makes it future proof if you're the type of person who uses a phone for more than 2 years. While right now there isn't a 5G network in our country, one can expect that to resolve itself in the next two years where this capability may come in handy.

But for many all of this culminates to one thing - photography. Samsung made a hue and cry about the cameras on the 20 Ultra but failed to deliver something that was flagship worthy. This time like in the design and performance department, it also manages to redeem itself in the imaging department with a truly audacious quad-camera system which is the most versatile one seen on a smartphone yet, and is easily the class of the field when one singularly looks at the Android crowd in terms of image quality. It falls behind the new iPhones in general reliability, usability and quality but makes up for the variance with the sheer audacity of its functionality and customizable nature.

Samsung uses a new generation of its 108-megapixel camera which outputs 12-megapixel photos unless explicitly asked to shoot at its native resolution using the pro-mode. The end results are impressive as it is consistently able to take rich, saturated and detailed photos that are also brightly lit up even in extreme situations. The night mode is also fabulous as it lights up even the darkest of scenes but at times it gives off an unnatural vibe. The focusing issues that plagued the S20 are gone as now there is a laser autofocus system to give it a helping hand. Versatility is its Forte as it can take gorgeous macros and lush landscape shots using the new Ultra-wide lens or can even double up as a telescope using its twin 3x and 10x optical zoomed-in cameras. These cameras enable 30x of lossless zoom which looks shockingly good. In fact, moonshots at even 100x look impressive but other than that, it's a feature that's more of a party trick than something that will be useful daily. Add on features like portrait mode also work impressively well.

A similar trend is repeated on video capture high has been a strong suit of Samsung's phones for years. This time around all four lenses on the back can output 4k video at 60 fps and generally, the quality is tremendous. That being said, it is still not the iPhone 12 level. Audio capture is similarly impressive. There is also a video booth mode which works quite well and a new birds-eye view mode dubbed directors mode helps one use these cameras more effectively. Similarly, the 40-megapixel front-facing camera now becomes the best selfie camera in the business.

Samsung has fixed everything that I hated about the Galaxy S20 Ultra and yet retained most things that I've loved about its phones for almost a decade. This includes class-leading haptics which makes this phone a delight to type on. Superb call quality and reception is a hallmark of this phone while general build quality and the quality of the audio from the stereo speakers is ridiculously good. It also now supports high-resolution audio over USB Type C and can output really great sounding music which would be the envy of audiophiles. The fingerprint scanner is also very accurate and responsive which hadn’t been the case for a couple of years, since Samsung decided to use Qualcomm’s ultrasonic scanners. This new generation of the scanner certainly hits the right notes and is bound to be secure, especially when coupled with Samsung’s Knox enterprise-grade security suite.

But all of this comes with some trade-offs. Samsung has for instance removed MST technology in Samsung Pay which makes the service almost useless in India considering the poor penetration of NFC enabled POS machines even in a city like New Delhi. There is no SD card slot so no memory expansion and even like I've mentioned before, it neither gets a robust facial recognition system nor does it have Ultra-fast charging technology.

Samsung's software -- One UI 3.0 which is based on Android 11 is good but not as good as Oxygen OS Or stock Android. It certainly isn't as elegant as iOS 14. It also comes with tons of duplicate apps and will likely not get software updates as fast as some other Android phones. But this is again something typically Samsung, as these trade-offs come with some benefits as well. Deep integration with Windows and Microsoft apps is one which will please a non-Apple user.",Review: Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra represents a redemption moment for the best Android phone,1,en

Now, reports suggest the company could add to the list this year by launching a new phone, the OnePlus Nord N1 5G. The phone has been tipped for launch by reliable tipster Max Jambor.

The upcoming smartphone is interestingly being tipped to launch later this year as a successor to the OnePlus Nord N10 5G that went official in Europe and the US. While the report does not reveal any information about the specifications of the device, it does add that it could launch after the OnePlus 9, 9 Pro, and 9E smartphones. As such, the tipster also suggests that we might have to wait a while for the launch of the OnePlus N1 5G. However, considering that the OnePlus Nord N10 5G was launched in October 2020, it can be expected that the OnePlus N1 5G also follows a similar launch timeline this year.

Even as we wait for the launch of OnePlus Nord N1 5G, the company is first scheduled to launch the OnePlus 9 series in India in mid-March. For now, the expectation is the OnePlus 9 series will bring with itself the OnePlus 9, OnePlus 9 Pro and another OnePlus 9 Lite model. The first two are tipped to be powered by the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset, while the latter could be powered by the Snapdragon 870 SoC.

Of the three, the flagships are the most interesting. The latest round of leaks reveals the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro will come with a 3.8mm punch-hole positioned at their upper-left corner with the former getting a 6.55-inch flat panel capable of Full HD resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. The Pro model is expected to be equipped with a of 6.78-inches curved edge display which will offer a Quad HD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.

As per reports, OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro will weigh less than 200 grams with the OnePlus 9 tipped to sport a slim profile of 8mm, while the Pro variant could come measuring 8.5mm in thickness.

Previously, we've seen reports about the OnePlus 9's camera module which is being said to be heroed by a 50-megapixel lens. As per a report on SlashLeaks, the phone will feature a three-camera system, the mainstay of which will be a 50-megapixel Ultra Vision wide-angle camera with f/1.9 aperture. The leak also reveals that this lens will be coupled with a 20-megapixel Cine Camera, an ultrawide lens with f/1.8 aperture. As for the third lens in the setup, there will be an OIS assisted 12-megapixel telephoto camera with autofocus and an f/3.4 aperture.

Reports also say that the phone maker is set to partner with Leica for the OnePlus 9 series. As per a well-known tipster, Teme(@RODENT950) multiple phone makers are partnering with Leica to bring their cameras on their phones, and apparently, one of them is the OnePlus.

306,3439,"We are not aware of the Sony smartphones even they still make smartphones. It is because sony already quit the Indian smartphone market years ago. Hence, Sony is not giving up and is now seemingly work to compete with the Samsung Galaxy S21 series. This smartphone will be a dubbed Xperia 1 III, and it will be the successor to Xperia 1 II launched last year. This flagship phone has the same 3.5mm headphone jack and bezel design. That does not mean that there will be no upgrades though the camera upgraded to a new periscope camera on the Xperia 1 III.

According to the rumors shared by OnLeaks, the specularities of the Sony Xperia 1 III will be in the boxy design with curved edges and a flat-screen. Sony has been unwilling to devising camera workarounds on its phones. The renders shared by OnLeaks say the Xperia 1 III has bezels on the top and the bottom of the phone wherein, the top portion has the front camera and all the sensors. The phone has a slim profile and the measurement 161.6×67.3×8.4mm and has a rear glass panel with a raised camera bump. All around, the phone has a metal frame, which makes a premium look. But all of this is quite similar to Xperia 1 II. The Sony Xperia 1 III will be coming with a 6.5-inch CinemaWide OLED display with a 4K resolution. Hence it is similar to Xperia 1 II that launched last year. With a triple camera setup on the back, the Sony Xperia 1 III will come much the same as last year’s model, along with a fourth ToF sensor. But there will be a better upgrade this time. The Xperia 1 III will have a periscope lens instead of a telephoto lens will increase optical zooming prowess on its phone cameras. ZEISS technology with ZEISS T coating powers all three cameras. The Sony Xperia 1 III will be coming with 5G connectivity. The processor is not be released yet, which processor chipset the company would go. The Xperia 1 II used processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 865, so hopefully, the Xperia 1 III will be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor. The phone comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack on the phone, a microSD card slot, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, dual front-firing stereo speakers, and a dedicated shortcut key to open the camera app by default that is programmed.",Sony’s next flagship product with a periscope camera besides 3.5mm headphone jack smartphones,1,en

Motorola had released the list of smartphones eligible for the Android 11 update in December 2020, but the company did not specify a timeline for the update. Now Moto G Pro has started receiving the Android 11 update. The update has been rolled out in the UK at the moment and is likely to expand to other regions soon. The official portal of the company points to the 21 January update but the moderator on Motorola's community page confirmed receiving the update on the Motorola Moto G Pro now.

The Android 11 update for the Motorola Moto G Pro takes up around 1.1 GB, while the January 2021 security patch weighs 1103.8 MB in size.

Since the Moto G Pro is a part of the Android One program, the phone is eligible for Android 12 update as well, as the phone debuted with the Android 10 operating system.

Talking of specs, the Motorola Moto G Pro comes with a 6.4 inch IPS LCD display with 1,080 x 2,300 pixel resolution.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to unbrick your Huawei devices using the Huawei Flash Tools IDT 2.0. While most smartphone manufacturers use the Qualcomm and MediaTek chipsets, some go for the Exynos ones. However, Huawei takes an altogether different approach. They have the ‘home-made’ Kirin SoC as the underlying chipsets. But even then, they are still quite an active player in the customization domain.

There is a plethora of custom binary, mods, and tweaks available for a wide range of devices. While unlocking the bootloader is still a challenging task, yet once you are able to do so, there are a plethora of customizations waiting for you. Right from the ability to installing a custom recovery like TWRP to rooting your device via Magisk, the possibilities stand endless.

However, while trying out the aforementioned tasks, there is always a chance of things going south. In other words, just a slight mistake in flashing any file, and your device might be in a bootloop or even worse, get bricked. But even if that happens, there is still a handy way out. You could easily unbrick your Huawei devices using the Huawei Flash Tools IDT 2.0. And in this guide, we will show you how to do just that. So without further ado, let’s get started.

Advertisements

Before we get started, there is an important point worth discussing. While Qualcomm devices come with the EDL mode that allows the respective tool to interact with their bricked devices, there is no such mode for Kirin devices. As a result, you will have to go for the Test Point method for your Huawei devices.

As for references, you could refer to some of our detailed guides on ISP EMMC PinOUT and Test Point and get yourself acquainted with this terminology. Once done, you may then head over to the below requirements section to unbrick your Huawei devices using the Huawei Flash Tools IDT 2.0.

STEP 1: Backup Data (if Possible)

The process is going to wipe off all the data on your device. But since your device is already dead, there isn’t any method as such to create a backup. However, if you do find a way to take a backup, then do so right away.

STEP 2: Charge your Device

Since you have a bricked device, you might not be able to get hold of the current battery percentage. So just to be on the safer side, keep it plugged in for around half an hour or so. This will charge your device sufficiently so that it doesn’t turn off midway during the process.

STEP 3: Install Huawei USB Drivers

Now download and install the Huawei USB Drivers on your PC. This will make it possible for your Huawei device to be identified by your PC.

Advertisements

Next up, download the Huawei Flash Tools IDT 2.0. This tool is developed by HiSilicon and allows you to flash XML image files onto Kirin based devices. Using this tool, we will bring your dead Huawei phone back to normal working condition.

STEP 5: Download Huawei XML Firmware File

Finally, you will have to download your device’s stock firmware in the form of the XML format. Double-check the file format as the IDT Tool only reads the XML files, any other format, and the tool wouldn’t be able to recognize. As far as downloading the firmware is concerned, you could check out our comprehensive Stock Firmware collection. If you can’t find one, then you could also search it online and download it from a trustworthy place.

To begin with, extract the contents of the downloaded Huawei Flash Tools IDT 2.0 to any convenient location on your PC. Go to the extracted folder and you should see the IDT file. Right-click on it and select Run as Administrator.

This will launch the IDT Tool. Click on the Tools icon situated at the top menu bar.

Doing so will bring up the Download Settings dialog box. Click on Browse next to Image XML File.

Then navigate to the XML file that you have downloaded for your device, select it and click Open. Now connect your Huawei device to the PC and Short Pinout it for the Test Point method. This will then make your device identifiable by the IDT Tool. Then from the USB Port, select the correct COM port to which your device is currently connected. If the tool isn’t able to read your device, you may also try switching over to any other port and then change the COM port accordingly. Finally, click on the Start button situated at the top menu of the IDT Tool. You could also go to the Operation menu and select Start.

The flashing process will now start and might take a few minutes. Once that is done, you will be notified of the same. You may then remove your device from the PC and boot it to the OS (if it doesn’t do so automatically). Likewise, you may now close the tool as well. That’s it. The process stands complete.

With this, we conclude the guide on how to unbrick your Huawei devices using the Huawei Flash Tools IDT 2.0. If you have any queries concerning the aforementioned instructions steps, do let us know in the comments section below. Rounding off, here are some equally useful iPhone Tips and Tricks, PC tips and tricks, and Android Tips and Tricks that deserve your attention as well.",Huawei Flash Tools IDT 2.0 | Flash Dead Phones Back To Life,1,en
309,3442,"New updates are being added at the bottom of this story…….

Original story (published on July 13, 2020) follows:

Vivo in May 2020 started the construction of a 32-story high-rise tower that will house its headquarters once completed in fall 2025. The tower, according to reports, will accommodate close to 6,000 employees, hopefully among them some of the company’s best software developers.

The Chinese smartphone vendor lags behind several others when it comes to timely software development. Sure, Vivo smartphones are receiving the update to Funtouch OS 10 based on Android 10. Matter of fact, a good number have already bagged the update. More details here.

But the OS is rolling out at a time when the newest Android 11 is already available in beta. To ensure that it doesn’t lag behind when the stable rollout begins, Vivo has already opened the beta program for developers who want to optimize their apps ahead of the Funtouch OS 11 rollout.

Since this is an early (pre-release) version of the software, only a limited set of Vivo smartphones can be upgraded to Android 11 so far.

Here, we bring you this list (table) of devices, and to ensure you don’t miss a thing, we will update it regularly whenever a new Vivo smartphone gets the beta or stable Funtouch OS 11 update.

New updates will be added in the section below

The tipster further reveals that the Mi 11 Lite will sport a 64MP primary camera. The optics at the back will also include the 5x zoom feature. Details about the other camera sensors are unknown at the moment.

The device will sport an OLED display with a hole-punch cutout. It is unknown if the display will come with a high refresh rate support.

The Mi 11 Lite launch is tipped for February 2021. Xiaomi is yet to make an official announcement on the same. The company, however, has announced the Mi 11 launch alongside MIUI 12.5 on February 8.

312,3446,"Poco M3 will be launched in the Indian market on Tuesday, February 2, at 12 PM. The phone has already been launched in international markets last year. Unlike the mid-range Realme smartphones, the Poco M3 could be a device suitable for those on a tight budget.

Poco M3 launch: Where to watch

Poco will launch its budgeted M3 smartphone via an online-only event. One can watch the live event on Poco's official YouTube channel. The live event can also be streamed on Flipkart's website and Poco India's social media channels.

About Poco M3

Since the phone has already been launched in the international market, therefore, its specifications are not hidden from the world. The Poco M3 will have two variants--one with 64 GB internal storage and the other with 128 GB storage.

The Poco M3 will feature a 6.53-inch full-HD+ display resolution. It will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 processor, backed by 6GB RAM and up to 128GB internal storage.

The Poco M3 is likely to feature a triple camera set-up, which includes a 48-megapixel primary lens with f/1.79 aperture, a 2-megapixel depth sensor with f/2.4 aperture, and a 2-megapixel macro camera lens with f/2.4 aperture. The device also gets an 8-megapixel selfie camera.

The phone packs a 6,000 mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The previous generation Poco M2 had a 5000 mAh battery.

Poco M3 will give customers three choices when it comes to colours. The phone will be available in these three colours--Cool Blue, Power Black, and flashy Poco Yellow.

Poco M3 price:

Poco M3 was launched in the United States at the end of last year with a price starting at $149 for the base 4GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage variant and $169 for the 4GB RAM + 128GB internal storage.

Therefore, in India, the phone could be priced in a similar range. The 4GB RAM+64 GB storage could be priced at Rs 11,000 and the 128GB could cost around Rs 12,500 in India.

What’s the one essential you’d go back home for if forgotten? Maybe it’s your mask. But also, your mobile phone, right? Your personal organizer, your digital wallet, your instant camera—your mobile device has become the most essential tool you use to stay connected to the people and things that are important at home, at the office, and everywhere in between. It has evolved from being a companion to your desktop computer to being your personal, daily companion.

SUPPORT US | TFY SPONSORED ARTICLES | BEST OFFERS

We’ve explored the evolving needs of people’s mobility and connectivity and we are announcing a number of new Microsoft 365 mobile-first capabilities that help people bring balance to their day. This includes organizing and transforming their physical world such as documents, photos, and live-action video into digital assets, and offer secure ways to help protect sensitive information.

Microsoft Outlook for iOS is adding breakthrough conversational AI technology in the coming weeks with Cortana, your personal productivity assistant in Microsoft 365. This experience is our first foray to deliver interactive, voice forward assistive experiences that aim to provide helpful ways of organizing your daily life.

Microsoft will soon introduce the ability for people to collaborate around user-created video content enhanced with intelligent scanning technology from Microsoft Lens in Teams mobile. Office Lens is now Microsoft Lens and we’re adding enhancements that improve quality and performance in the new Lens app as well as the Microsoft 365 productivity apps that integrate the Lens technology such as Teams, Outlook, and Office.

Microsoft Lens will be able to recognize English handwriting and text to further accelerate digital transformation. Coming first in the Lens app followed by Office mobile, you will be able to transcribe handwritten notes into text to simply add them to your documents. We are also pleased to announce that the Office app is now optimized for iPad and will be available mid-February in the Apple App Store.

Watch the video below to see what’s possible with people’s ingenuity and mobile technology in action.

Your mobile device is an extension of you in both your work and personal lives. As your daily companion, with Microsoft 365 mobile apps, it offers assistance with everyday tasks and commitments to help you achieve a sense of wellbeing and control with the possibility of getting extraordinary things done. Our apps provide the ability for you to transform and collaborate around modern multimedia content and help provide the privacy and protection you need to safely express yourself from your mobile devices. For organizations, providing new ways to create, curate, and collaborate around mobile, user-generated content will unleash the power of your workforce’s creativity. And supporting a secure and inclusive culture for self-expression that is centered on people’s data and identity protection will free workers to focus on business outcomes.

Microsoft helps you stay in control of your day with Outlook as your personal organizer, Teams as your hub for teamwork, and Office as a workplace for your content. Let’s explore how Microsoft 365 mobile apps and services are evolving with the changes in people’s mobility and connectivity.

Helpful ways to organize your life

The shift to remote work and the changes brought on by the global pandemic have resulted in an explosion of apps and services and the blurring between work and personal lives that ties us to our devices around the clock. More tools often mean more notifications and distractions that make it hard to focus on what matters.

We are investing in AI at scale to learn how people work, collaborate, and connect so we can help them stay in control of their day, and feel more balanced and organized. Freeing people from being tied to screens, simplifying tasks into micro workflows, minimizing the burden of app, and process disaggregation are all capabilities centered on people’s evolving needs—helping them in turn focus on work and personal commitments.

Productivity assistance experiences in Outlook

Microsoft is reducing the effort it takes to perform frequent tasks and actions by building assistive, anticipatory experiences, and providing a more natural way of automating your day-to-day activities (processes and workflows).

We will soon roll out the first Microsoft 365 conversational AI capability in Outlook across email, calendar, and search. With this update, Cortana will be able to orchestrate your voice input with on-screen experiences to simplify your personal productivity and organization. You will be able to manage your time and schedule events and meetings in Outlook, add participants to meeting invitations, and compose messages using your voice, speaking with the language you use every day. By harnessing the full power of human voice, Microsoft AI, and the intelligent technology of the Microsoft Graph, we are starting our journey to enable Cortana to learn about you and your preferences in grammar and recognize your voice nuances, accent, and dialect. This new capability is our first step towards a full conversation experience. Our goal is to make it faster and easier to ask Cortana to help get things done with your voice than typing on a small keyboard—it’s with the intelligence that comes from the Graph that enables Cortana to get to know the people with whom you work, collaborate, meet, correspond, and share.

Cortana, your personal productivity assistant enables conversational AI in Outlook for iOS.

Cortana in Microsoft Teams

We’re also announcing that Cortana in the Teams mobile app will soon be expanding beyond English in the U.S. to English in Australia, Canada, U.K., and India. With Cortana in Teams, you can use spoken, natural language commands. Click the button on the top right and ask Cortana to make a call, join a meeting, send chat messages, share files, and more.

Microsoft Search in Teams and Office mobile is adding support for natural language queries in English in the U.S. With Teams mobile, you will be able to type phrases in the search box or tap on the mic to ask Cortana to find messages, chats, meetings, people, files, and links bookmarked by administrators in a way that covers keywords as well as a range of time in Teams. In addition, you will also be able to ask Cortana to look for messages or chats from a particular person, topic, or across a range of time. For example, “Find the Marketing deck from last month” or “Search for messages from Megan.”

Use natural language to find what you need in Teams

In Office mobile, you can use Microsoft Search when you use a work account with your Android device to easily find files you need using natural language. To enable collaboration and connectivity to your content from virtually anywhere, Office mobile will also enable you to easily find and manage your multimedia content. Scanned documents, pictures, and other images will be automatically organized into albums where you can add more images as necessary. For example, receipts from restaurants can be saved in a single album, easily retrieved, converted to PDF, and shared any time. Albums can also be saved in OneDrive. For business customers, images will also be searchable based on the content of the image, in addition to the standard file name. These updates will roll out first in English to customers in the United States for Office for Android in the coming weeks, followed by Office for iOS.

Micro tasking shortcuts

Many of life’s little tasks and much of our daily work are getting done in fleeting moments. People need the tools and tips that support quick actions. Whether we like to refer to these things on our To Do list as life hacks or micro tasks, Microsoft is delivering experiences in mobile apps that automate mini workflows to lighten the burden of your everyday commitments and tasks. Here are just a few that are either already in the apps you use every day or rolling out soon:

Create a quick form or poll in Office or Teams and check out responses in the apps.

Transform your physical world into digital

There was a time when mobile devices were primarily used to access information and media viewing. But since then, where, what, and when people use their mobile devices has evolved. There’s now a proliferation of modern content and multimedia created using mobile devices. For example, YouTube has become known as one of the primary learning content resources for businesses and personal video sharing through social platforms is now commonplace worldwide. We realize that people are using their phones and tablets as an additional screen—no longer in your purse or pocket but constantly beside you, on your desk, or in your hand. As an additional screen, mobile devices are being used for back up when the internet network is unavailable or unstable, for multi-tasking on different apps across devices, as storage for drafts or photos, or to use specific mobile features such as the camera or mic.

Creation, communication, and collaboration are now all central to mobile productivity which means that people need their content and important documents to be digitized and available from anywhere across devices. Where once Microsoft was the leader in paper digitization with the advent of the PC and disk storage, we are now a leader in cloud computing and the digitization of everything else, making it less about the device and more about the mobility and connectivity of people.

We are introducing new capabilities that will help accelerate the transformation of your physical world into digital with mobile technology so you can create and collaborate around modern people generated content. One of the Microsoft 365 technologies that simplifies this digital transformation is Microsoft Lens.

The new Microsoft Lens will enable the integration of short video bites in Teams Chat. If a picture speaks a thousand words, imagine what video content collaboration can do to advance teamwork when you enable people to express their ideas with self-created, video content. With Microsoft Lens built into Teams, you will be able to record a short video, annotate it with text, emojis, do basic editing, and add live filters. In real-time, add your thoughts about what you’re capturing with video from Teams and share it immediately with your colleagues. Expect to see this capability integrated into Teams in preview by the end of this quarter.

Take short video snippets, annotate, and share your thoughts in Teams

Put a lens on things that matter

Handwriting from whiteboards, notes, letters, and other non-typed text can also be scanned and transcribed. The capability will first be available in the Microsoft Lens app and followed by Office mobile in a future release. You will be able to scan handwritten letters, to-do lists, and other material and simply convert it into text.

Transcribe handwriting into text in your Office documents.

Microsoft has improved the scanning quality with the Lens technology with better edge detection and added filters too. Over time, these improvements will be added where the Lens technology is already integrated across Microsoft 365 apps such as Teams, Outlook, and Office.

Office mobile has also enhanced the PDF annotation capabilities in Actions. Now you will be able to add notes, shapes, dates, and timestamps to your PDF documents in addition to the existing inking functionality.

Combining Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into one Office app on iPad is a powerful way to create content with the camera, sign PDFs, take notes, and collaborate with others. We’re pleased to optimize the Office experience on your preferred devices and once available in the Apple App Store, Office for iPad can be your go-to app for getting work done.

Office optimized for iPad and multitasking.

Personalize and protect your digital identity

Increasingly, people are using their personal devices for work as well as sharing them more between coworkers and family members. This adds complexities for organizations to keep company data safe while enabling employees to work and connect the way they need to individually and as teams. People need confidence that when they use their mobile apps to represent themselves digitally, their privacy is protected, and their sensitive information is kept safe through their end-to-end content creation, communications, and collaboration journey.

As Microsoft is run on trust, we are rolling out mandatory sensitivity labeling in Outlook mobile and will be rolling it out in Office by the end of the quarter. Microsoft Information Protection gives organizations the ability to define the policies required to help protect company data and meet compliance requirements. By setting the policies at the organizational level it helps employees stay compliant and reduces accidental sharing of information outside the organizational boundaries. We’ve built the full strength of Microsoft security, compliance, and identity solutions into Microsoft 365 mobile apps. From threat and data protection to app and risk-based access management, you can read the full story in a new article we are publishing today.

People are increasingly using their mobile phones to present their digital self, and now as content creators, also value the flexibility to personalize their experience and brand themselves when using mobile technology. Adding sentiment to your communications is a way to represent yourself authentically in your communications. You can already add reactions in social and team environments such as Yammer and Teams, but indirect, asynchronous email communications, how do you share your sentiment without generating masses of additional messages? Reactions in Outlook offer a new way to add sentiment and reactions to emails and conversations and we are announcing today that general availability will start to roll out in the coming weeks in Outlook mobile and on the web. Through a new inbox notification experience, you will be able to glean the sentiment of other Outlook users and add to email conversations without filling up your inbox. In future releases, we plan to add @mentions and other notifications in Outlook too.

Let them know how you feel with reactions in Outlook.

Microsoft 365 mobile apps center on the needs of people, to help them be their authentic self, to create, collaborate, communicate, and stay organized on mobile in quick and secure ways. Our goal is to also help organizations support their workforce with the best possible mobile experience. To this end, we recently released a new mobile adoption center for Microsoft 365.

We encourage you to try all the new capabilities mentioned in today’s article when they become available to you in Teams, Office, and Outlook, and the rest of the suite of Microsoft 365 mobile apps and as always, we love to get your feedback.

HMD Global is planning to make India a hub for its global supply chain while also launching affordable 5G Nokia phones in the country this year, as revealed by the company's vice-president Sanmeet Kocchar to Financial Express. The executive added that HMD Global is looking to launch customised smartphones in the Indian market and for this, it recently teamed up with Dixon Technologies, which is one of the largest consumer electronics solutions companies in India to produce Nokia phones. HMD Global had secured $230 million from Google, Qualcomm, and Nokia Technologies in 2020 and is now aiming to invest in capacity expansion. This also includes investing in Indian manufacturing and distribution as well.

HMD Global's vice-president, Sanmeet Kocchar said, ""We are looking at India as an important market and the first thing that we are going to do is look at products which are customized for the Indian market. Second is 5G, which is an important space that we have decided to play in, and we are looking at how we can launch more affordable 5G devices this year."" In the regulatory filing about the partnership, Dixon said that its subsidiary, Padget Electronics would make Nokia smartphones at the Nodia Facility in Uttar Pradesh. The top executive added that the company has expanded its distribution in India with 700 plus partners, thereby strengthening its offline presence.

Furthermore, Kocchar said that going forward HMD Global aims for better product differentiation through future-proof software that would last for at least a couple of years before upgrading. Reiterating their commitment to the 'Make in India' initiative, the executive said it is manufacturing 100 percent of its devices in India and that the PLI scheme is also a great initiative from the government. Foxconn subsidiary RSMI manufactures a significant number of Nokia devices that are sold in the country.

Sanmeet says there is steady progress in terms of the number of components that are sourced in India and the quantity of components that are being procured from India has gone up. However, the company says that it doesn't have plans to set up its own factories at the moment, instead, it intends to work with partners for manufacturing, production, and distribution.

315,3450,"Smartphone price in India could go up due to increased taxes

Key smartphone components such as chargers, camera modules, and PCBs will now be taxed

More OEMs may start selling smartphones without a charger in the box to cut down on costs

The Indian smartphone market could witness yet another price hike, thanks to the new tariffs introduced by the Indian Government during the Union Budget 2021 on Monday. Essentially, smartphone manufacturers will now have to pay an extra 2.5 percent duty to import mobile parts and parts of chargers in order to promote local manufacturing. Mobile parts such as printed circuit boards, camera modules, batteries, and connectors will fall under the same category. Considering that most smartphones manufactured in India are merely assembly plant for the aforementioned peripherals, the overall price of the finished product will undoubtedly go up. As always, the additional cost will be passed to consumers.

Also read: Mi TV 4A, 4A Pro, Horizon Edition, and more receive up to Rs 3,000 price hike in India

Phones may become more expensive in India

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had the following to say about smartphones and smartphone peripherals, ""Domestic electronic manufacturing has grown rapidly. We are now exporting items like mobiles and chargers. For greater domestic value addition, we are withdrawing a few exemptions on parts of chargers and sub-parts of mobiles. Further, some parts of mobiles will move from 'nil' rate to a moderate 2.5 percent"". This means that smartphones and chargers will get more expensive in India soon. Here's how much tax each part will attract.

Many smartphone OEMs already operate on razor-thin margins in the hypercompetitive Indian market. With the additional increase in costs, they'll have no choice but to cut additional corners, further compromising on key, but often neglected aspects such as type of material used, quality of components, etc. The increased tariff on accessories also incentivises more companies to adopt Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi's strategy of removing the charger from the retail packaging. Other consumer electronic goods such as air conditioners and refrigerators will get more expensive too.

The budget smartphone is said to be priced below EUR 100 (approx Rs 8,900), though the phone’s India price could be lower if it comes to the country that is. The Nokia 1.4 is tipped to come with a 6.51-inch HD+ display and an unspecified 1.3GHz quad-core processor. The entry-level device is said to come with just 1GB RAM and 16GB internal storage, which would make it an Android Go smartphone.

Qualcomm’s interview with Mr. Luo Yizhou, the co-founder and CEO of Black Shark Mobile, Q&A:

You have said, “Black Shark wants to improve user experience, first perfect gaming experience, second hardware to reach gaming level, and third daily experience on par with high-end flagships.” How can you do that? Luo Yuzhou: For gaming phones, performance is the foundation of the gaming experience and the cornerstone of creating the ultimate gaming experience, so in all generations of Black Shark products, we have used Qualcomm Snapdragon’s top mobile platform, just to bring the best gaming experience to players. Of course, our new Black Shark 4 gaming phone in 2021 will also use Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 888 5G mobile platform to continue to provide the top gaming performance for handheld gamers. In addition to top performance, a perfect gaming experience also requires the support of other technologies, a stronger cooling system architecture to ensure the continuous output of top performance, a more diverse control scheme, more accurate and sensitive touch response speed, and better sound and picture performance. Although Black Shark is a gaming phone, I think it also performs quite brightly in terms of daily use experience.

In the red sea of the smartphone market where many smartphone brands are competing, Black Shark’s strong focus on the gaming segment is admirable. Luo: It’s not easy to keep the original intention, since the emergence of game phones, they have been controversial, and many voices are expressing that playing hand games does not necessarily require a game phone. However, the biggest reason for us to stick to this direction is to make the game more enjoyable for players. The belief of not compromising on the gaming experience and providing the top gaming experience for players has kept us going until now. Now there are more and more players who recognize the game phone and enjoy the extraordinary experience brought by the game phone. At the same time, the gradual rise in the length of users in the game scene also indicates that the demand for mobile games is becoming bigger and bigger. Along with the gradual popularization of 5G technology, we believe that the mobile game market will also undergo more changes and bring more new elements, and Black Shark will continue to provide more outstanding game phone products for the majority of hand game players. What is your ideal “ultimate mobile gaming experience in the 5G era”? Luo: The arrival of the 5G era will inject new vitality into the mobile gaming field, as higher transmission speed and lower network latency have already been recognized in the current gaming scene. In the future, with the gradual maturity of more cutting-edge technologies such as cloud gaming, we may experience more game masterpieces on gaming phones, and this will also put forward new demands for future mobile gaming hardware carriers, such as richer control methods and stronger heat dissipation performance. Black Shark will also continue to follow up the development of cutting-edge technologies and be well prepared for the future gaming era. In this extraordinary year of 2020, Black Shark has still achieved very remarkable results in the field of gaming phones, what are the engraved stories of Black Shark’s 2020, and what are the further plans for 2021? Luo: 2020 is destined to be an extraordinary year. In 2020, BlackShark will launch its first 5G gaming phone product, and mobile communication will officially enter the “5G era”, and the arrival of 5G will bring a broader imagination and development opportunities for the mobile gaming field. As the leader of the gaming phone market, Black Shark has been sticking to its original intention to create cell phone products with the strongest gaming experience. In 2020, to bring the best control experience to players, we launched the Black Shark 3 Pro, which for the first time designed the physical-mechanical buttons inside the phone body and integrated with the phone body, this innovative product form has been unanimously recognized and loved by players. At the same time, an excellent gaming experience cannot be achieved without the support of top performance. With the support of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 mobile platform, Black Shark 3 series products have strong performance, which also provides a more stable and smooth gaming experience for the majority of hand gamers. In 2021, Black Shark will launch a new gaming phone product equipped with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G mobile platform. In addition to top performance, the new product will also bring more breakthrough game-oriented technological innovation to players, providing a more outstanding product experience for mobile game players. “In 2021, Black Shark will continue to work together with Qualcomm to unleash the potential of 5G and create an infinite future together!”

Samsung’s patent was published in January this year by the World Intellectual Property Office. The patent spotted by Lets Go Digital, shows a Samsung smartphone with a rotating camera mechanism where the rear sensor doubles as a selfie camera. There are three cameras at the back with a mechanism that pushes up one sensor and rotates it 180 degrees to function as a selfie camera. Samsung rotating camera patent. (Lets Go Digital)

The functionality is similar to the Galaxy A80 where all the rear cameras rotated to work as selfie cameras. But in this Samsung phone, the camera pops up and then rotates towards the front. Based on the patent, the primary sensor of the rear camera setup will act as the selfie camera. This would mean better quality selfies, and also a true all-screen design. The rotating camera design looks complicated though, and it could require delicate handling of the smartphone.

Smartphone brands have also tried their hand at under-display cameras but we’re yet to see one that performs as expected.

335,3473,"While there is not much known about the exact specifications of the iQOO 9, leaks have suggested that we might see a bigger battery in the upcoming device.

iQOO is all set to launch a new smartphone, the iQOO 9, pretty soon. The smartphone will reportedly have significantly better specifications than its predecessors. The iQOO 7, which was released in China last month, packs the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G chipset under the hood and also features 120W fast-charging support. While the devices in the iQOO family rivalled other flagships in terms of specification, the battery capacity always held these devices back. However, it seems like iQOO is all set to solve this drawback with the launch of the iQOO 9.

iQOO 9 Launch Timeline, Battery Capacity, and More Leaked Online Ahead of Reveal

According to popular leaker Digital Chat Station, the iQOO 9 will feature a dual-cell battery consisting of two batteries of 2155mAh each. The equivalent battery capacity for the device will be around 4400mAh, which is higher than the 4000 mAh battery present in the iQOO 7. The iQOO 9 will also support fast charging over 100W. Considering that the iQOO 7 already supports 120W fast charging, it shouldn’t be surprising to see the same implemented in the iQOO9.

The upcoming iQOO smartphone might launch in the second half of 2021. While the increase in battery capacity might not seem to be that significant on paper, the higher battery capacity bundled with fast charging support makes the overall package quite enticing. Moreover, considering the fact that the devices already weigh over 200gms, to begin with, iQOO is reluctant to use a higher capacity battery as it might make the devices even bulkier.

Apart from that, there is not much known about the exact specifications of the device. The last device in the iQOO family, the iQOO 7, features a 6.62-inch FHD+ punch-hole display with HDR10+ and 120Hz refresh rate. it comes with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC with 12GB LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB UFS3.1 storage.

336,3474,"Vivo recently launched its flagship, X60 series, of smartphones in China. Since then, we've been eagerly waiting for the phones to finally come to India, and now it appears there's finally some information on the same. As per a new leak by 91Mobiles, Vivo is planning on bringing the X60 series to India in late March or April. Interestingly, in India, the series will include not only the Vivo X60 and X60 Pro, but also the X60 Pro+.

The leak, however, reveals nothing else and leaves us guessing about the price and internals of the X60 series phones in India. But a quick look at the Chinese pricing of the devices could give us a good hint about the price of the devices in India.

As for the specs, the three devices should bring pretty much the same spec sheet that they flaunted in China. Of the three, the most interesting is the X60 Pro+. The phone comes with a 6.56-inch OLED display which comes with a 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. The panel also offers support for features like HDR10+. Underneath the display is a Snapdragon 888 GPU which is 35 per cent faster and 20 per cent more power-efficient than the previous generation. This chipset has been paired with fast LPDDR5 RAM and enhanced UFS 3.1 storage.

For cameras, the main module uses a large 50-megapixel ISOCELL GN1 sensor. This has been sat next to a 48-megapixel lens. This is an ultrawide module (114°, 14mm) which also gets support for the gimbal stabilization system. The lens is an IMX598 sensor that offers 0.8µm pixels. There's also a 32-megapixel lens and an 8-megapixel lens to complete the set-up. The latter is a periscope camera with 5x optical magnification, which can go up to 60x with digital zoom.

To keep the phone running, there's a 4,200 mAh power pack that supports fast charging at 55W over the USB-C port. Also of note is the fact that the phone does not support wireless charging.

337,3476,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman delivered her third Union Budget in Lok Sabha on Monday, February 1.



Govt slashes revenue expectation from telecom sector; pegs receipts at ₹53,986 crore.

The government has lowered revenue estimates from the telecom sector while pegging expected receipts at ₹53,986 crore in the next financial year, according to the budget documents presented in Parliament on Monday.

The Finance Ministry in the Budget for 2020-21 had projected a revenue of ₹1.33 lakh crore from the telecom sector which was slashed steeply to ₹33,737 crore in the revised estimates presented in the Budget on February 1.

“Receipts under ‘Other Communication Services’ mainly relate to the license fees from telecom operators and receipts on account of spectrum usage charges. Department of Telecom collects recurring licence fees from various Telecom Service Providers licensed by it,” the document said.

The licence fee is levied at 8% of the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) — which is considered as income from sale of telecom services.

The lowering of revenue estimate comes at a time when the government has set the ball rolling for the spectrum auction in which radiowaves valued at ₹3.92 lakh crore will be put on the block.

Import duty on mobile phones and chargers increased.

The government proposed to impose import duty on components of mobile phones and chargers, to enhance local value addition.

“For greater domestic value addition, we are withdrawing a few exemptions on parts of chargers and sub-parts of mobiles. Further, some parts of mobiles will move from ‘nil’ rate to a moderate 2.5 per cent,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.

The FM announced review of 400 exemptions in customs duty including those applicable on the mobile devices segment.

She added that the custom duty policy must have twin objectives of promoting domestic manufacturing and helping India get on to global value chain and export better.

This may increase the process of smartphones as the manufacturers may pass on the increased 2.5 percent customs duty on import of electronic components, which go into manufacturing the devices to the consumer.

“Its impact on consumers will be in the range of 0.3% to 0.4%,” said Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA).

Under the new proposed regime, only exports are likely to be spared the hike in customs duty and any phones produced in India for domestic consumption will attract the hike in customs duty. However, the industry feels that the competitiveness, which had been delivered through the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, will now be eroded through the new announcement.

“Phased Manufacturing Program (PMP) was not working and exports were weak. That propelled production-linked incentive (PLI) for the sake of competitiveness to address disabilities. This spate of duties takes us right back-queering the pitch for electronics exports. We request the government to maintain the status quo.

The mobile and electronics sector should have been spared the general removal of exemptions where there were zero percent import duty. Zero custom duty does not mean zero taxation. These inputs suffer 18% GST also,” added Mohindroo.

Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) director general (DG), SP Kochhar

“We are a bit disappointed that concerns of the telecom sector, which is the backbone of digital India, remained unaddressed. We were expecting a reduction in the burden of levies, such as LF and SUC on the telecom sector. The Government has also not considered the request of the Industry to exempt the GST from the payment of Govt Levies such as LF, SUC and spectrum installments etc.

As the telecom operators are going to launch 5G services in the country, it is imperative that 5G enabled telecom equipment are available to them at a reasonable price. Thus, there was the need for a reduction in customs duties on telecom equipment.

It would have been a much awaited relief if the government provided the right incentives to the sector.”

Mobile phone service providers had earlier sought a reduction in licence fees (LF), removal of goods and services tax on those fees, spectrum acquisition charges and spectrum usage charges (SUC) , besides a refund of input tax credits along with tax and custom duty exemptions

Govt allocates ₹14,200 cr for telecom infra roll out in 2021-22

According to the budget document, the finance ministry has earmarked an outlay of ₹5,200 crore to rollout the entire optical fibre cable (OFC) required for setting up the Defence communications network, issue purchase order for all equipment components for the entire project to commission nationwide dedicated full-fledged communication network.

The finance ministry has allocated ₹9,000 crore to boost telecom connectivity across the country which includes high-speed OFC or satellite-based broadband services across the 2.2 lakh village panchayats in the next financial year.

The government has set a target to lay 6.7 lakh kilometer of OFC, 1.2 lakh wifi access points and 6.5 lakh fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) connections to be installed in 2021-22.

The budget has made provision to install 600 mobile towers for 4G services in Arunachal Pradesh and two districts of Assam and another 600 mobile towers for 4G in Meghalaya. The finance ministry has earmarked an outlay of ₹5,200 crore to rollout the entire optical fibre cable required for setting up the Defence communications network

Andaman and Nicobar Island, which has been connected with OFC in August, will get 124 mobile towers for 4G service, naxal affected areas will get 1,000 mobile towers, aspirational districts will get 350 mobile towers and 354 villages uncovered in Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir and in border areas will get one mobile tower each.

IT

IT Firms India’s biggest services export contributors received little attention in the budget. There were no sops to boost the future of information technology from Sitharaman this year for companies including TCS Ltd., Infosys Ltd., Wipro, HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra, along with mid-sized firms like LTI, Mindtree, Persistent and Hexaware.

Some industry responses

Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman, Bharti Enterprises

“The first Budget of this new decade reimagines India in the form of Aatmanirbhar Bharat like never before, Coming in the backdrop of a global pandemic, it boldly spells the government’s growth agenda and march towards building a new and prosperous India. The Budget clearly has the stamp of our Prime Minister with a clarion call for ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’ and ‘Vocal for Local’. The efforts of the FM to restore economic growth while elucidating a clear road map in the health care, infrastructure and insurance sectors is bound to bring confidence to the industry and global investors, providing a much needed reassurance of the government’s strong support.”

Anand Agarwal, Group CEO, STL

“This is overall a positive and progressive budget that aims to boost the economy through increased government expenditure, and focuses aptly on healthcare and people.

We welcome the government’s strategy of infrastructure-led recovery through higher allocation and reforms in power, roads and ports. However, the time was apt to bring parity on spending between digital and physical infrastructure, especially at a time when we look to aggressively move towards becoming a $5 trillion economy. The budgetary allocation of INR 6,000 crore towards BharatNet is a step in the right direction, and an outlay towards building and modernising digital infrastructure would have set the foundation for achieving accelerated growth and bridging the digital divide. The government demonstrated a stronger focus on innovation through an allocation of INR 50,000 crore for the National Research foundation. A budgetary allocation for digital infrastructure can complement this focus, paving the way for disruptive technology innovations”

Navkendar Singh, Research Director, International Data Corporation (IDC)

“The benefits to local manufacturing and exports that the increase in customs duty will bring about will offset the price increase. From an export perspective, this will push companies to start putting major scales here to manufacture, he said. With mobile chargers set to get slightly more expensive, this can lead mass phone companies to offer phones without a charger in the box from the second half of the year, in line with the practice followed among phones priced above ₹50,000.”

Rajesh Maurya, Regional Vice President, India & SAARC, Fortinet.

“The budget has announced big-ticket projects to add to the digital capabilities with the next general census in the country being the first digital one and along with marque MCA 21 project this is likely to garner massive ‘crown jewel’ assets in terms of the sensitivity and quantity of data. As these projects are rolled out it will increase the importance of security as the government builds the tools and workflows supporting these services. These projects will need to prioritize solutions such as Zero Trust Access, automated endpoint security, users awareness training to counter a range of threats, and will also need to ensure that solutions such as software defined networking and multi-cloud services are implemented securely.

The real challenge in securing these digital assets that will continue to be targeted by both criminal and nation state (APT) actors is the availability of skilled resources. Fortinet is committed to closing the cybersecurity skills gap through our CSR training programs. The Fortinet Security Academy Program is provided free by nineteen leading universities in India to equip students with the skills necessary for a career in cybersecurity. By supporting these leading universities in India, we’re arming the next generation of security leaders with the skillset and knowledge the industry so desperately needs.”

Sanjay Jalona, CEO & MD, L&T Infotech.

“We welcome the increased focus on Innovation and on ease of doing business. This budget appears to have set the right pace for India’s journey to a digital first approach. From an IT services perspective, the industry is facing an intense global competition and needs tax incentives and digital infrastructure support to ensure seamless work from anywhere ecosystem, which is the new normal. This is a critical requirement for the sector that employs nearly 4.5 million professionals, contributes 8% of the country’s GDP, has created high-quality jobs during the pandemic, and is the face of Brand India across the world.”

Aalok Kumar, President & CEO, NEC Corporation India.

“The Government’s commitment to streamlining the country’s infrastructure from roads to railways to shipping to waterways to build a new India is consistent and commendable. The infusion of multiple thousand crores into the construction of national highway projects and dedicated freight corridors reflects the creation of a new connected India. Linking cities through metro lines and increased access to travel facilities will also boost the much-needed employment generation. While we were looking forward to specific initiatives and encouragement for the technology industry, the continued focus on driving digital transformation using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and digital records in governance, smart cities, transportation, logistics and aviation will have a contagion impact and empower the economy in the long run.

339,3479,"Samsung OLED UL verified

Samsung display recently showed a bright and clear display in the outdoor environment can also be bright OLED display screen. Today, Samsung Display said that this latest OLED display for smartphones has been verified by UL, a global safety science company, for its excellent “Sunlight Visibility”.

Samsung OLED UL verified

In the evaluation, UL tested two aspects that affect the outdoor visibility of the display: color gamut and brightness. The results found that the color gamut of Samsung’s new OLEDs met 73% of the DCI-P3 standard in an outdoor environment, and the maximum brightness exceeded 1500 nits.

Previously, smartphone screens were difficult to see characters and colors in outdoor environments, and users would have a strong sense of visual cutoff. And in the outdoor visibility of this challenge, OLED is relatively unaffected. Because OLED displays color through self-lighting, at the same time, has a wide color gamut and can display highly saturated colors, so even in the poor visibility of the outdoor, can also display relatively clear picture quality.

Especially worth mentioning is that the new OLED uses a new organic material that achieves a brightness of 1500 nits or higher, thus further enhancing outdoor visibility. Choi Soon-ho, head of Samsung Display’s small and medium-sized marketing team, said, “In the 5G era, it is very important that screens have bright and clear image quality in any environment, whether indoors or outdoors. Samsung OLED is the perfect display for mobile devices in the 5G era, and it will provide new value to consumers.”

The new OLED, which has received UL outdoor visibility verification, will be equipped on flagship smartphones from global handset manufacturers, including the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, which has already been released by Samsung Electronics and will soon be available to consumers around the world.

717,3958,"Deleted Photo (Images) Ko Recover Kaise Kare Mobile Phone Me
May 4, 2017 by Rohit Mewada
Agar aapke Mobile me koi Important Image thi jo aapne delete kardi or ab aap chate hai ki wo aapke mobile me wapas aa jaye, to wo aap aasani se recover kar sakte hai.
Ye jo tarika me batane wala hu wo Android Phones ke liye hai or ye ek App hai jiski madad se aap Delete kiye hue Photo or Video ko recover kar sakte hai. Iss App ki sabse khas baat ye hai ki agar 1 saal phele delete kiya huaa photo bhi agar aapko recover karna hai to aap iski madad se kar sahte hai.
Ye jo App hai Photo recover karne ka wo bina root ke bhi kaam karta hai, par isme wo puri files ko scan nahi par pata.. fir bhi bhut si files aa jati hai.. Par agar aapka Mobile rooted bhi hai to aap Image ke sath sath Video bhi recover kar sakte hai.
Mobile Root kaise kare uski jankari ke liye yaha jaye:
Kisi Bhi Android Mobile ko Root kare in 5 Apps se Bina Computer
Android Phone Root Krne ka Sbse Aasan Tarika (Without PC)
Android Smartphone Phone Root Kaise Kare Uski Jankari
Android Phone se Delete hue Photos ko Recover kaise kare
Chaliye dekh lete hai aapko Kya karna hai or kaise deleted photo ko recover karna hai.
Step 1: Sabse phele aapko apne mobile me DiskDigger Photo Recovery App install karna hai.
[button color=”” size=”” type=”square” target=”blank” link=”https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.defianttech.diskdigger&hl=en”]DiskDigger Photo Recovery[/button]
Step 2: Ab Simple App ko Open karege to aapko ek button dikhega Start Basic Photo Scan uspar click kare.
Step 3: Ab aapke phone ki scaning start ho jayegi.. isme thoda time lagega.. aap wait kare or agar aap bich me bhi cancel karna chahe to kar sakte hai.
Mene apne Mobile me scan kiya to usme 20 minutes lage, jisme mere mobile ki 43728 Images ko scan kiya, dekha jaye to ye bhut hi jada hai.
Step 4: Ab aapke samne puri image aa chuki hai.. Aap jinko bhi recover karna chate hai select karke recover ki button par click kare.
Step 5: Ab Image ko save karne ke liye pucha jayega.. Device ko select kare save karne ke liye.. aap chahe to online bhi save kar sakte hai.
Is trha aap apni delete ki hui image ko wapas la sakte hai.
Agar aap Image or Video ke aalawa koi bhi dusri file ko recover karna chate hai jese Songs, documents to uske liye aap is App ka Pro version tri kar sakte hai.
wese to ye app bhut badiya hai or aapke mobile me bhi jarur work karega par agar nahi karta hai to aap Dumpster Photo & Video Restore ko tri kar sakte hai, ye bhi acha app hai Image or Video ko recover karne ke liye.
[button color=”” size=”” type=”square” target=”blank” link=”https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&hl=en”]Dumpster Photo & Video Restore[/button]
Ummid hai aapko ye App helpful rahega, agar aapka koi sabal hai isse related to aap comment karke jarur puche.

718,3959,"Flipkart Free Delivery Trick 2019 Step by Step in Hindi
August 25, 2019 by Rohit Mewada
Flipkart Free Delivery Trick: agar aap Flipkart se shopping karte hai ya kuch kharidna chate hai to aapne dekha hoga 500 rupee se kam ka saman order karne par Delivery Charge lagta hai.. HMH ki iss Post me aapko wahi Delivery Charge kaise bachaye uski jankari dene wale hai.
Flipkart par lagbhag sabhi saman mil jata hai or Offers ke Time to bhari discount bhi mil jata hai.. ab agar hamne 100 rupee ka saman order kiya to 40 rupee delivery charge lagta hai jo thoda jada lagta hai..
Latest Flipkart Free Delivery Trick 2019: Online Free Delivery Saman magwane ki bhut si trick uplabd hai, par unme jankari tikh se share ki ki gai step my step kaise ye Trick work karti hai. me aapko bilkul tested tarika Step by step batane wala hu.
Flipkart Free Delivery Trick in Hindi
Flipkart se kuch bhi order kar rahe hai agar wo total 500 rupee se jada hai to hame kisi Flipkart Free Delivery Trick ki jarurat nahi hai, usme koi Delivery charge nahi lagta.. Simple Flipkart se Order place kar sakte hai.
Agar 500 rupee se kam ka saman order karna hai jab Free Delivery Trick ki jarurat padegi..
Example: jese aapko koi product order karna hai jiski kimat 100 rupee hai par usko order karne par 40 rupee extra delivery charge lag rahe hai. to aesi condition me aapko jo product lena hai uske sath koi dusra product me cart me add karna hai jisse jo Total amount hai wo 500 se jada ho jaye. Iss baat ka dhiyan rakhe jo dusra Product aap cart me add kar rahe hai wo Flipkart assured marked ho. Card me add karne ke baad Cash On Delivery (COD) se Order Place kar dijiye or Order place karne ke baad jo Product aapko chaiye usko chhod kar dusre Product ko Cancel kar dijiye.
Chaliye Inn Flipkart Free Delivery Trick ko Step by step samaj lete hai:
Step 1: Flipkart App Download kare..
Download Flipkart App
Step 2: Ab aapko jo bhi Product kharidna hai wo Cart me add kare. jese mene LakeMe ka ek product add kiya jiski kimat 150 rupee hai
Step 3: Ab koi aesa Product search kare jiski kimat mila kar total 500 rupee se jada ho jaye Total.
Aap niche Image me dekh sakte hai muje Lakme Sun Expert chaiye or uske sath mene Philips ke bulb bhi add kar diye jinko mila kar total kimat 500 se jada hogai hai, jiske karan jo Delivery charge lagna tha wo kam ho gaya.
*Iss Baat ka Dhiyan rakhe jo Dusra Product hai to Flipkart Assured ho, warna ye trick kaam nahi karegi.
Step 3: Total Card Value INR 500+ hone ke baad COD se Order place kar dijiye.
Step 4: Order Place hone ke baad, jo dusra Product aapko nahi chaiye wo Cancel kar dijiye.
Iss Trha aapko 500 rupee se kam ka product bhi bina delivery charge ke mil jayega.
What are the Flipkart delivery charges?
Flipkart par Delivery Charge alag hai kuch Product par 40 to kuch par 50..
Flipkart se agar aap 500 se jada ka saman order karte hai to aapko koi delivery charge nahi lagega par agar aap 500 se kam kimat ka saman order karte hai to aapko delivery harge lagage.. or kitna lagna hai wo aap Payment page par aakar dekh sakte hai.
Disclaimer: Ye Trick sirf Educational Purpose ke liye hai, please aap iss Flipkart Free Delivery Trick ko 4 baar se jada use naa kare, warna aapka account block bhi ho sakta hai.. Agar aapko ye Trick use karna hai to aap New account bana kar try kar sakte hai.

720,3961,"Google AMP Kya hai |⚡ Accelerated Mobile Pages ke Fayde Nuksan
July 18, 2017 by Guest Author
Friends aaj Is Post me Mai aapko bataunga Google ke Ek New Project ke Baare me Jisko naam Diya gya hai Google AMP / Google: Accelerated Mobile Pages.
Google AMP kya hai? AMP ko Kis liiye bnaya gya hai? And Google AMP use karne ke kya fayde hain or Google AMP Use kaise kare.
Agar aap nahi jante ki Google Accelerated Mobile Pages kya hai to is Post ko padhne ke baad aap achi tarah se samajh jayenge ki Google AMP kya hai.
Table of Contents [hide] [hide]
#1 Google AMP ⚡ kya hai ?
#2 Google AMP Work Kaise Karta Hai ?
1. AMP Html
2. AMP JS
3. AMP Cache
#3 Google Ne AMP Ko Kyu Create Kiya ?
#4 Google AMP Se SEO Par Kya Effect Padta hai ?
#5 Google AMP Ke Advantages (फायदे)
#6 Google AMP ke Disadvantages (नुकसान )
7) Google AMP Other Information
Conclusion
#1 Google AMP ⚡ kya hai ?
AMP Google ka ek Open Source project hai jise Publishers/Bloggers/Website Owners ke liye bnaya gya hai. AMP ki help se har koi Website Owner apni Site me Mobile-Optimized contents create kar sakta hai jo ki sabhi Devices (Phone, Tablet) me fast Load ho jata hai.
Ham sabhi jante hai ki aaj ke time me Smartphone ek Popular Device hai and har koi Smartphone ko sabse jyada Use me lata hai. Websites me aane vala mostly traffic bhi mobile devices se hi aata hai. Isiliye Google ne apna New Project AMP start kiya because Website ka Loading time se bhi uske Traffic par bahut jyada affect padta hai.
Google ka AMP project ko start karne ka main Goal ye hi hai ki vo apne users ko ek Best Mobile experience de sake and kisi bhi Type ki Website har kisi Mobile Device me bahut ki kam Time me load ho jaye taaki Users ko Site open hone ke liye wait na krna pade.
Google AMP product manager ke according ek AMP-coded page ka load time 0.7 seconds hota hai jabki Non-AMP pages ko open hone me maximum 22 Seconds lagte hain jiske karan Site ke Traffic bahut hi Low ho jata hai.
#2 Google AMP Work Kaise Karta Hai ?
Google AMP ek Open Source framework hai, basically ye HTML ka faster version hai jise AMP HTML kaha jata hai. AMP pages ko javascript se Optimize ,CSS3 se customize kiya jata hai and Sabhi AMP Pgaes cached hote hai yaniki Jab bhi Website me AMP Pages enable hote hai to Website ko open karne par site ke Sirf main Contents hi load hote hai jisse Site fast load ho jati hai.
AMP Page me jitne bhi extra widgets hote hai wo load nahi hote, usse site ki speed bhut fast ho jati hai.
AMP ko 3 Parts me Divided kiya gya hai.
1. AMP Html
AMP Html bhi ek Html language ki tarah hai but AMP Html ko customize karke Tyaar kiya gya hai. AMP Html page me bhi Regular Html tags add kiye gye hai but kuch Html tags ko AMP Specific tags se Replaced  kiya gya hai.
(EX. <img> ko <amp-img> se replace kiya jata hai)
in Custom Tags ko AMP Html Components ka name diya gya hai.
2. AMP JS
AMP JS Library ka work AMP Html Pages ko Fast Render (प्रस्तुत) karne ka hai.
3. AMP Cache
AMP Cache ek Proxy-based delivery network hai jiska work AMP Pages ko Deliver karne ka hota hai. AMP cache AMP Html pages ko Fetch and Cache karke pages ki performance ko automatically Improve karta hai.
#3 Google Ne AMP Ko Kyu Create Kiya ?
Google ka AMP Project ko Start karne ka main maksad ye hi hai ki users ko ek fast Load speed dena chahte hain because aaj ke Time me Google ka Other Search engines se ek serious Competition hai and agar Google apne Users ko Search Result ke Through kisi Website ko access karne ke liye ek Best speed deta hai to Google Easily apne Market Share ko maintain kar sakta hai .
AMP create karne ka Other reason Logon ko Mobile Web ki taraf Attract karna hai. Because Google ki Khud ki kuch Top Mobile Installed Apps hain joki unke Market Share ka Bhi Source hai isliye jitne jyada Mobile users Increase honge Utna hi Benefit Google ko Bhi milega.
#4 Google AMP Se SEO Par Kya Effect Padta hai ?
AMP Search Engine ranking factor nahi hai and agar aap apni Website me AMP use karte hai to search Ranking me aapko kuch jyada fayda nahi hoga because Search Ranking ko Better karne ke liye aapko sabhi Factors ko Follow karna hoga jo Ranking ko Increase karne me helpful hote hain.
But agar ham baat kare Website ke SEO ki to Speed matter karti hai because agar aapke site ki Loading Speed best hai to Traffic bhi Best hi hoga and aapke site me Organic Traffic increase hoga. AMP ke Faster Load ki help se Site ka Traffic and Bounce Rate bhi kam hoga.
Search Engine Optimization ke liye Website ka Responsive/Fast Loading hona bahut jaroori hai and Google AMP ka work hi website ko Responsive bnane ka and fast load ka hai. So AMP ko Use karne se Site ke SEO par bhi Good Effect padega.
#5 Google AMP Ke Advantages (फायदे)
Google AMP Mobile users ke liye bahut hi faydemand hai because AMP Pages Enable sites ka Load time and Performance Non AMP Sites se Better hota hai and ham jante hai ki 70% People Mobile se hi Web Surfing karte hain.
agar koi Site Open/Load hone me bahut time leti hai to koi bhi Us Website ko Open karna pasand nahi karta. AMP ki help se User Easily Website ko Surf kar leta hai.
Website ki Performance and Load Time better hone se Website ka Organic Traffic Increase hota hai joki Publishers ke liye ek good Income generate karne ka Best source hai.
#6 Google AMP ke Disadvantages (नुकसान )
Google AMP Project Ads ko support karta hai it means AMP pages me aap Ads ko bhi add kar sakte hain but AMP ke use se Mobile se hone vala Revenue limited(सिमित ) ho jata hai because AMP pages only main contents ko hi Load karta hai joki ek bahut hi bada Disadvantage hai.
AMP Google Analytics ko bhi support karta hai but Analytics ko AMP me add karne ke liye Different tags ki Requirement hoti hai jinhe pure AMP pages me implement karna hota hai jisme bahut saara Time lagta hai.
7) Google AMP Other Information
Google AMP Project ke baare me kuch Aur janne ke liye ampproject.org
Google AMP Demo dekhne ke liye g.co/ampdemo
Conclusion
Google AMP abhi new project hai, jisme abhi bhut se problems bhi hai jinko sahi kiya ja raha hai.. to aese me agar aapko coding ki sahi janakari nahi hai to aap khus se kuch bhi code edit karke AMP implement naa kare..
Agar aapka Blog WordPress par hai to aap AMP Plugin ko install karke kar sakte hai. or agar blogger part hai to aap Blogger AMP Template use kare.
Mai aapko Recommend karunga ki aap apne Site ke Pages (About us, Contact us) par AMP ko implement kare esa karne se aapke Site ki Search Engine Ranking me Improvement hoga.

723,3964,"Jio Free Recharge App | Jio Free Mobile Data Trick for Unlimited Internet
November 26, 2018 by Rohit Mewada
Jio Kya hai ye to aap jante hi hoge, or agar aap ye article read kar rahe hai matlab aapke pass Jio SIM bhi hai, jisme aap Free Internet chalana chate hai. Iss Article me ham janege kaise Jio Free Recharge karke Unlimited Mobile Data pane ki trick.
Agar aap Mobile use karte hai to aapne kabhi na kabhi aese kisi App ke ware me jarur suna hoga, jiski madad se Mobile se paise kama sakte hai.
Mera favorite or sabse jada popular ek App tha jiska naam tha mCent jo ki ab band ho chuka hai, aapko jaan kar herani hogi sirf mCent App se mene ₹70,000+ kamaye hai.. jisse lagbhag 1.5 saal tak ghar me kisi ka bhi mobile ka recharge ke paise nahi lage..
kher ab to Jio SIM aa chuki hai or data bhi saste me mil jata hai or Unlimited call bhi.. par fir bhi hame Jio Recharge ke liye ₹199 ka monthly recharge to karana padta hi hai.. par agar me kahu aapko wo karane ki bhi jarurat nahi hai to kesa rahe ;)
Aap mCent Browser ki madad se Simple Internet ko chala kar uske recharge ke paise kama sakte hai.. jisse hoga ye aapke jo thode bhut paise lag rahe hai Recharge me wo lagna bhi ban ho jayega.
Table of Contents [hide] [hide]
Jio Free Recharge App
mCent Browser Earning Trick
Jio free Recharge App | Free data trick
Jio Free Recharge App
Free recharge kamane ke bahut se app hai.. jese Truebalance, mCent .
Aap mCent Browser App Download kar lijiye, niche diye button par click kare.
mCent Browser
Note: AGar aap Refer link se Download karege to aapko 25,000 points bonus milege.
Install karne ke baad, Simple aapko App open karke apna Mobile number register karna hai..
Ye ek Browser hai, jese Dusre Browser (UC Browser, Chrome etc).. jisme ham net chalate hai.
To ab aap jab bhi Net par kisi website ko open kare, ya FB, YouTube dekhe to aap iska use kare..
jitna bhi website or page aap mCent Browser me open karege aapko uske Points milege.. or aap Point earn karke Joi Free Recharge kar sakte hai.
mCent Browser Earning Trick
Jesa ki aap ye to samaj chuke hai ki ye ek Browser hai, to aap isme jab bhi net chalayege uske aapko point milege..
Yaha ham paise to kama rahe hai, par aesa nahi ki uske badle me hame ads dikayeg jate hai, ulta agar kisi website par jada ads ho to ham ads block bhi kar sakte hai.
yaha jo browser karne se point milte hai wo to kama hi sakte hai.. par jo mere favorite tarika hai wo hai refer karke point kamane ka.
Agar aap apne Friends ko refer karege to aapko 25,000 or aapke friend ko 25,000 points milege.. iss trha aap refer karke recharge ka paisa to badi aasani se nikal hi sakte hai.
mCent Browser me 1000 point ki Valur ₹1 rupee ke barawar hai, to aap calculate kar lijiye kitne point aapko kamana hai.. or mere hisab se utne point kamana chtkiyo ka khel hai.
Jio free Recharge App | Free data trick
jo mCent Browser App hai wo usse aesa nahi hai ki sirf jio par hi recharge hota hai, par Jio ke liye usme ek special offer hai 50% Off ka, matlab aapko recharge karne ke liye point bhi kam lagege.
to ab aap jaan chuke jo Jio Free Internet kaise chala sakte hai or kaise Jio Free recharge kar sakte hai.
Agar aapne abhi tak mCent Browser install nahi kiya hai to yaha click karke abhi install kare.. aesa nahi hai ki ham isme paise kama rahe hai to fokat ke ads aate hai, samne.. ulta ham jo website ke ads hai wo bhi block kar sakte hai agar bhut jada hai to..
me aapko recommend karuga, agar aap UC Browser use karte hai to usko uninstall karke isko use kare.. or sath me earn karke free Recharge bhi kare.
Agar aap isko use karte hai pehle se ya ab karege to comment karke apna expriance jarur share kare, taki or user ko bhi bharosa ho jaye, ki mCent App ki madad se Free Jio Recharge kar sakte hai.

1: Always Use original charger
2: Turn on Airplane Mode
3: Turn off Bluetooth, GPS and WiFi
4: Don’t use phone (when phone is charging)
5: Switch off Your Mobile
Android mobile ko fast charge kaise kare ?
अगर आपको Fast Charge करना है फ़ोन को तो आप निचे दी हुई बातो का ख्याल रखे।
1: Always Use original charger
कभी भी अपने mobile को चार्ज करें तो सिर्फ original charger का उपयोग करें, जो आपके फ़ोन के साथ दिया होगा, क्योंकि अगर आप दूसरे charger का उपयोग करते हैं, तो हर एक charger की volt power और empire  अलग होती हैं, लेकिन जो फ़ोन के साथ charger मिलता हैं वो उस फ़ोन के हिसाब से दिया रहता हैं की कितने volt और empire से फ़ोन बढ़िया तरीके से चार्ज होगा ।
अगर आपका चार्जर ख़राब हो गया है तो में आपको सलहा दुगा आप Fast Charger ही ख़रीदे, आप निचे दी हुई link से खरीद सकते है।
Buy Fast Mobile Charger
2: Turn on Airplane Mode
जब आप अपने फ़ोन को चार्ज में लागये, तभी आपको अपने फ़ोन को flight mode या airplane mode में switch on कर देना हैं , ताकि network का load नहीं रहेगा आपके फ़ोन पर , और जितने भी connectivity होगी , सभी बंद हो जायेगी, ऐसी स्थिति में आपके फ़ोन की बैटरी तेजी से चार्ज हो सकती हैं ।
*धियान रखे ऐसा करने पर फ़ोन भी नहीं आएगा क्यू की नेटवर्क भी नहीं होगा।
3: Turn off Bluetooth, GPS and WiFi
जब कभी आप अपने फ़ोन को चार्ज में लागये, ध्यान रहे की फ़ोन की Bluetooth, GPS और WiFi बंद होना चाहिए, क्योंकि अगर आप इन सभी service को on किये रहते हैं तो वो service चलता ही रहता हैं, जिससे बैटरी को चार्ज होने में ज्यादा समय लग जाता हैं ।
4: Don’t use phone (when phone is charging)
जब आप अपने फ़ोन को charge कर रहे होते हैं तो आपको अपने फ़ोन का use नहीं करना चाहिए, अगर आप use करते हैं तो उस समय एक तरफ आप अपने फ़ोन को डाउन करने में लगे हैं और दूसरी तरफ आप उसको charge करने में लगे हैं, ऐसी स्थिति में आपका फ़ोन तो चार्ज बहुत slow होगा और बैटरी भी खराब हो सकती हैं ।
5: Switch off Your Mobile
अगर आप चाहते हैं की आपका फ़ोन जल्दी ही चार्ज हो तो उसके लिए आप ऊपर बताये गए 4 स्टेप्स को भी फॉलो कर सकते हैं। अगर आप उन चारों स्टेप्स को फॉलो नहीं करना चाहते हैं तो ये स्टेप्स आपके लिए बहुत ही सिम्पल और बढ़िया हैं।
इसमे आप अपने फ़ोन को ऑफ कर दे , जब आप चार्ज में लगाते हैं तब ताकि आपके फ़ोन की सभी सर्विस बंद जो जाएगी , जिससे आपका फ़ोन बहुत जल्द ही फुल चार्ज हो जायेगा ,
इस स्टेप्स को आप android phone ही नहीं और भी phone जैसे, featured phone और iphone में भी इसका उपयोग कर सकते हैं अपने मोबाइल फ़ोन को Fast charge कर सकते है ।
–
तो अब आप जान चुके है कैसे mobile को fast charge करते है, मेरे दुआर बताई टिप्स के आलावा भी अगर आपके पास कोई टिप हो जिससे जल्दी चार्ज कर सके फ़ोन को तो comment में जरुर शेयर करे।

Nice compilation ……some methods I use apart from above listed
1. do not use PC/laptop usb port for charging (some people do that ) but always use proper electrical socket
2. I have wireless charger for my samsung phone but I feel that charging through this consumes more time.
3. If you remove your mobile cover/case while charging it would dissipate heat faster thus charges faster.
4. Switching off phone while charging is good enough but may loose any call. In this case we may close all running applications and then charge it.
