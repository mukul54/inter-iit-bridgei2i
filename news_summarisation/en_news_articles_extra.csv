The company has regularly launched its Galaxy Note series smartphones in the second half of the year, but it looks like plans have changed for 2021. The development was shared by Samsung Electronics' President and Co-CEO, Koh Dong-Jin at Samsung's 52nd regular shareholders meeting. Koh, who heads Samsung's IT and Mobile Communications division, also said that the South Korean tech company does not plan on abandoning the Galaxy Note series altogether and that it was just for this year."", ' Samsung typically announces its new Galaxy S-series of flagship smartphone models in the first half of the year and the Galaxy Note-series in the second half of the year. This year, it seems the company has decided not to follow up its Galaxy S21 series launch with a Galaxy Note series. Koh at the 52nd regular shareholders meeting was cited by Bloomberg to have said, ""Note series is positioned as a high-end model in our business portfolio,” he said. “It could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year so it might be difficult to release Note model in 2H."" Jin could be referring to the S Pen support which was the primary differentiator between the Samsung Galaxy S-series and the Galaxy Note-series till last year, and the move may be an effect of the overall chip shortage. A report by South Korean publication Ddaily also shared the same information.', ' The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the first Galaxy S-series phone to support the S Pen and was launched in January this year, alongside the Galaxy S21 and the Galaxy S21+.', ' The CEO also said that the company does not plan on abandoning the Galaxy Note series and will likely release it next year. ""The timing of Note model launch can be changed but we seek to release a Note model next year,"" Bloomberg quotes him to say. Just like many other tech companies facing repercussions of a global semiconductor shortage, Samsung also called it a ""serious imbalance"" referring to the global shortage. ""Despite the difficult environment, our business leaders are meeting partners overseas to solve these problems. It\'s hard to say the shortage issue has been solved 100 percent,” Jin added.', ' The semiconductor shortage first hit carmakers and now the South Korean tech giant has voiced concerns about it as well. However, according to a report, some analysts believe these shortages could be solved in the coming months.', ' Prior to the release of the Samsung Galaxy S21 series smartphones, there were reports that the company was planning on discontinuing its Galaxy Note line since it would become hard to differentiate between the Galaxy S and the Galaxy Note series if models in both the series support the S Pen.', ' Is Samsung Galaxy S21+ the perfect flagship for most Indians?

The Beijing-based software company claimed that the latest Realme flagship manipulated the results of its performance in the multithreaded workload and JPG decoding sections of the AnTuTu app. The Realme GT was launched in China earlier this month and comes with a top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC. Companies including Huawei and OnePlus have previously been caught manipulating benchmark scores to attract customers.', ' AnTuTu has posted a note on Weibo to inform users about the removal of the Realme GT from its benchmarking platform.

The phone is said to have used mosaic colour blocks instead of processing the image verbatim genuinely, to reduce its quality and cut down processing efforts, the company said.', ' AnTuTu said that both delaying threads and modifying the reference image are against the purpose of giving fair benchmark results. As a result, AnTuTu decided to remove the phone from its listing. The company also said that after seeing the higher-than-usual benchmark scores, it did question Realme but received no response.', ' AnTuTu has given an ultimatum to Realme to provide clarity on benchmark cheating, and modify the system to avoid manipulating results. AnTuTu said that it would otherwise remove the Realme GT permanently from its listing.', ' AnTuTu also mentioned that it is currently working on further optimising the anti-cheating programme that would be available on the version 9 of the benchmark app. The new version would deduct points and levy other penalties if it finds any cheating issues.', ' Realme had not responded to Gadgets 360 for a comment at the time of filing this story.', ' [Update, Tuesday March 16, 7PM] Realme has sent the following statement reproduced in full:', ' Realme GT is equipped with the latest Snapdragon 888 5G platform, bringing users high performance. Benchmark scores of Realme GT are all accurate data under the current versions of the Antutu benchmark. Realme has always been committed to bringing users excellent performance, the actual user experience is the top priority for Realme.\xa0On the other hand, regarding the test issues doubted by both sides, we are in touch with Antutu to sort it out positively.', ' At the time of this update, AnTuTu has not issued any further update.', "" In the past, companies including\xa0Huawei,\xa0OnePlus, and Oppo were found cheating benchmark results.

Prosser derived these details about the battery pack from a source who is “not sure” whether both the model will launch or not. While he doesn't detail what reverse charging on the battery pack means, it could presumably be the ability to charge AirPods or other Apple accessories wireless from the other outer side of the pack at the same time."", ' As per Prosser, Apple could just introduce one of these variants and the reverse charging model may never see the light of the day.', "" However, this isn't the first time we're hearing about these MagSafe-compatible battery packs.

Kuo has also predicted that the iPhone 13 Pro models, while preserving the notch design, will come with a 120Hz ProMotion display — the one that has so far been featured on the iPad Pro models. Kuo's latest series of predictions also talks about the iPhone SE 5G model planned for 2022, no favour for a USB Type-C iPhone model in the near future, and a foldable iPhone speculated for 2023."", "" The note, as reported by AppleInsider, speculates that the iPhone 13 Pro successor will be Apple's main iPhone release to abandon the notch and “adopt” the hole-punch display design. This could be similar to what has already been a part of many Android smartphones, including the latest Samsung Galaxy flagships."", ' Apple may expand the hole-punch display design across all its iPhone models after an initial adoption on the iPhone 13 Pro replacement aka iPhone 14 Pro in 2022 — depending on production yield.', ' In addition to the hole-punch design, the iPhone 14 models are also expected to have an upgraded selfie camera at the front, with autofocus support.', ' Kuo also reportedly foresees that Apple is planning to bring iPhone SE 3 or iPhone SE (2022) model with 5G support. This new addition is believed to boost 5G replacement demand. Further, the new iPhone SE is also expected to have an upgraded processor.

Some recent reports also suggested in-display Touch ID support on the next-generation iPhone models. However, Apple may take some time to decide whether it's feasible to go for a technology that's already available on many Android phones nowadays."", ' Interestingly, a USB Type-C design and a Touch ID-integrated power button both are already available on recent iPad models.', "" Kuo's note also reportedly mentions details about the iPhone 13 models, that are expected to be unveiled later this year and are also in the rumour mill as the iPhone 12s series. The analyst predicts that the iPhone 13 family — or simply the 2021 iPhone — would comprise four models just like the iPhone 12 models. There will be a thinner notch, and the Pro models are forecast to have 120Hz ProMotion display backed by an LPTO panel."", ' The Pro models are also said to have an upgraded six-piece ultra-wide camera with a wide f/1.8 aperture and autofocus support. This seems an update over the six-piece f/2.4 fixed-focus camera available on the iPhone 12.', ' Kuo reportedly mentioned in his note that the 2021 iPhone models might be slightly heavier, due to the potential of featuring larger battery capacity. The new series is also likely to come with a “space-saving design” that would include an integrated SIM card slot and a thinner selfie camera module.', ' The analyst also predicts that Apple may launch a 7.5 to 8-inch foldable iPhone sometime in 2023 by fixing production issues with the technology in 2021. Some patent images suggested the design of the foldable iPhone surfaced in the recent past.', ' Kuo is also predicted that Apple could unveil a new 6-inch iPhone in 2023 as an upgrade to the iPhone 11, with an LCD screen, Face ID, and a sub-$600 (roughly Rs. 44,000) price tag. The company is also believed to have a flagship iPhone in 2023 with an in-display fingerprint sensor, periscope telephoto camera, and a “real full-screen design” experience that may not include any holes or notches.', ' What will be the most exciting tech launch of 2021?

238," Samsung ISOCELL GN2 50-Megapixel Image Sensor Announced With Staggered HDR, Dual Pixel Pro Technology","[' Samsung ISOCELL GN2 sensor can simulate a larger 2.8μm-pixel with four-pixel-binning technology', ' Samsung has introduced the new 50-megapixel ISOCELL GN2 sensor with large 1.4-micrometer (micron or μm) sized pixels. This sensor succeeds the ISOCELL GN1 sensor seen on many smartphones, and integrates a new Dual Pixel Pro technology. This technology utilises 100-million phase-detecting photodiodes that perceive phases both vertically and horizontally for faster and more accurate auto-focusing. It also supports staggered HDR for better detail and low power consumption. Samsung says the new staggered HDR feature has reduced energy consumption by up to 24 percent.', ' The South Korean electronics giant says that the ISOCELL GN2 sensor is currently in mass production and there are no exact launch plans announced, or which phone will integrate it first. The new ISOCELL GN2 sensor from Samsung has a 50-megapixel image sensor and comes with Smart ISO Pro to offer better results in low light conditions. The 1/1.12-inch ISOCELL GN2 sensor can simulate a larger 2.8-micron pixel with four pixel-binning technology to absorb more light in low-light conditions. The sensor also offers an option to take pictures in 100-megapixel resolutions. The 100-megapixel mode rearranges the colour pixels using an intelligent re-mosaic algorithm, creating three individual layers of 50-megapixel frames in green, red and blue. These frames are then up-scaled and merged to produce a single ultra-high 100-megapixel resolution photograph.', "" Dual Pixel Pro technology on the Samsung ISOCELL GN2 sensor offers accurate and fast auto-focusing, Samsung claims, adding that it is the company's most advanced phase-detection auto-focus solution yet. It offers all-direction focusing by splitting the pixels not only vertically, as with Dual Pixel, but also diagonally. Dual Pixel Pro enables improved low-light focusing and tracking of moving objects as well, as every pixel of the sensor works as focusing agents. Additionally, there is a new staggered HDR feature integrated that uses rolling shutters over the same pixel arrays to capture multiple frames in short, middle, and long exposures. By maximising the dynamic range, staggered-HDR is able to offer rich detail and vivid colour in highlights and dark shadows within the scene, the company claims. Samsung says staggered HDR is able to reduce the energy consumption of a sensor by up to 24 percent when compared to the predecessor's real-time HDR mode."", "" Samsung's new ISOCELL GN2 sensor also has Smart ISO and Smart ISO Pro support to elevate light sensitive photos. For instance, in extreme low-light, Smart ISO Pro quickly takes and processes multiple frames in high ISO, raising the light sensitivity close to one-million ISOs. The GN2 supports full-HD videos at 480 fps or 4K at 120fps."", ' Is Samsung Galaxy S21+ the perfect flagship for most Indians?

Apple has been developing the attachment for at least a year and it has been scheduled to launch in the months following the release of the iPhone 12 line, according to people with knowledge of the product. The iPhone 12 models were introduced in October.', "" The battery pack would attach to the back of an iPhone 12 using the MagSafe system, which all the new phones use for charging and pairing other accessories like cases and wallets. Some prototypes of the battery pack have a white rubber exterior, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the product isn't yet public. The new accessory would differ from Apple battery add-ons for previous iPhones in that it only provides additional battery life and doesn't serve as a full protective case."", "" In internal testing, the magnetic attachment system has proved strong enough for the charging unit to stay in place, but the accessory's development has been slowed by software issues such as the iPhone erroneously indicating that the pack is overheating. Apple also has been working to mend issues related to a customer switching between using the device on an iPhone sometimes with and without a case."", "" Given the new accessory's development challenges, it could ultimately be delayed or scrapped, the people said. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment."", "" Apple's hardware engineering department is careful about launching accessories related to charging.

A beta version of Apple's upcoming iOS 14.5 software update included a vague, later-removed reference to a battery pack, according to a finding by developer Steve Moser."", "" The wireless charging device could be a popular accessory for Apple's new MagSafe ecosystem. Last year, Apple released cases with MagSafe compatibility, leather wallets and a pair of chargers."", "" The Apple accessory, if ultimately launched, would rival similar offerings released by small makers in recent months.

Developers working on Android TV apps can also get the first Android 12 developer preview via the ADT-3 device.', ' Before proceeding to manually download any of the system images, it is important to note that the Android 12 Developer Preview 1 is meant specifically for developers and not intended for end consumers. You may, thus, encounter some bugs or issues after installing the developer preview.', ' Alongside announcing the new developer preview, Google shared Android 12 release timeline to detail the milestones reaching the new update. You can check the timeline below.', "" In addition to the aforementioned timeline, Google has said that Android 12 will reach the ‘Platform Stability' stage through the Beta 4 stage in August. This means from that point, there won't be any further changes for developers."", ' The first developer preview of Android 12 brings interface-level changes to notifications. Google has also mentioned in its blog post that it was also working on optimising transitions and animations across the system to make them smoother. Apps targeting Android 12 will also be able to include notifications with custom content views that will be based on a standard template.', "" “This template ensures that custom notifications have the same decoration as other notifications in all states, such as the notification's icon and expansion affordances (in the collapsed state) and the notification's icon, app name, and collapse affordance (in the expansion state),” Google detailed."", "" In addition to custom notifications-focussed updates, Android 12 is in development to bring more responsive notifications. You'll notice the changes in the first developer preview that are likely to be further polished in later updates."", ' Android 12 Developer Preview 1 also brings compatible media transcoding to support HEVC format for video capture. Google has also provided platform support for AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) using AV1. This is claimed to dramatically improve image for the same file size when compared to older image formats, such as JPEG.', ' The first developer preview of Android 11 also includes foreground service optimisations through an expedited job in JobScheduler and a new release of Jetpack WorkManager library. There is also a new unified API to enable rich content insertion and accept rich content from sources including clipboard, keyboard, and even drag-and-drop gestures.', "" Apps designed for Android 12 will also be able to offer audio-coupled haptic feedback through the phone's vibrator. This means that you'll get more immersive audio experiences on the next-gen Android update."", ' Further, Google has simplified immersive mode to smoothen gesture navigation and make it more consistent. Android 12 also comes with an Android Runtime (ART) module to let Google push new software updates to the core runtime and libraries available on devices. This will enable a more consistent experience for installed apps.', ' Android 12 will also be about optimisations for tablets, foldables, and TVs. Some of those optimisations can be noticed from the first preview.', ' The first developer preview of Android 12 also includes modern SameSite cookie behaviours in WebView, Restricted Netlink MC, and safer exporting of components to prevent apps from inadvertently exporting activities, services, and receivers. There will also be other under-the-hood privacy and security changes that Google has detailed on a dedicated webpage.', ' Apart from the changes mentioned by Google, Android Police reported a list of new features that includes a one-handed mode, emergency SOS button, scrolling screenshots, and better notification snoozing. The first Android 12 preview also includes an improved screenshot editor and an updated Nearby Share feature with the ability to share Wi-Fi passwords.', ' Google has mainly provided the features that are essential for development purposes. But nonetheless, we can expect some interface-level changes and improvements in the future Android 12 developer preview and beta releases.', ' What will be the most exciting tech launch of 2021?

The publication says that the application was filed as early as November 11, 2020 and was completed on January 6 this year."", "" The deal ensures that all existing trademarks, logos of Essential are now intellectual property of Nothing.

In February, the company announced that it was shutting down. Essential was expected to launch a uniquely designed elongated phone, under “Project Gem,” along with a few more Essential Phone successors. Those plans were soon discarded as the company winded up.

As per the company website, Nothing was founded soon after. Following a $7-million (roughly Rs. 50 crore) seed funding round, Nothing announced its mission statement earlier this year – “To remove barriers between people and technology, and create a seamless digital future.” In February, Nothing led another round of fundraising, this time accumulating $15 million (roughly Rs. 109 crore) with the help of GV (formerly known as Google Ventures).

However, that disappointment isn't likely to affect the company's roadmap for 2021 as it is rumoured to still have the mini version amongst other models."", ' Citing people familiar with the development, tipster Jon Prosser claimed in his video on YouTube that Apple is working on the follow-up of iPhone 12 mini this year — irrespective of the poor results it received from the last year model.', ' “My sources are saying that Apple is still committed to making a follow-up, [the iPhone] 13 mini even if they just have to make less of them than they originally planned to,” he said.', "" Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo last year noted that the iPhone 12 mini — along with iPhone 12 — didn't meet expected demand. Market research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) also mentioned in its report that the iPhone 12 mini resulted in only six percent of the total iPhone sales during October and November. JP Morgan supply chain analyst William Yang even predicted that iPhone 12 mini production might be discontinued by the second quarter of 2021 due to weak demand."", "" However, several reports in the past suggested that Apple would follow the same four-model lineup this year that it introduced last year. It is important to note that the company may have decided its next lineup even before seeing the market performance of the iPhone 12 series. This means that the decision for picking the mini version of its new iPhone isn't likely to be something that Apple took after seeing unexpected results of the iPhone 12 mini."", "" Prosser said in the video that the arrival of iPhone 13 mini might help Apple as it wouldn't launch the iPhone SE successor this year."", ' “If we get an update to that [the iPhone SE], it will actually be an iPhone SE Plus — making room for a 13 mini,” the tipster said.', "" One of the reasons for not meeting expectations with iPhone 12 mini is muted demand for smaller versions of flagship devices these days. Analyst firm Counterpoint recently said that screens under 6-inch accounted for around 10 percent share of all smartphones sold. But nonetheless, the news about the launch of the iPhone 13 mini may excite people who're looking for the successor to the iPhone 12 mini."", "" Apple hasn't yet provided any details about iPhone 13 series (or what some people believed as the iPhone 12s series). It is, thus, safe to consider the reported information with a pinch of salt."", "" Will iPhone 12 mini become the affordable iPhone we've been waiting for?

For the name, Google has seemingly gone with Snow Cone this time as Android 12's source code reportedly has references to “sc,” believed to be an abbreviation for Snow Cone. It should be noted that Google has not shared any information on the new OS, so this information should be taken with a pinch of salt."", ' Android 12 source code shows multiple references to “sc” that is believed to be an abbreviation for Snow Cone.

Android's auto-rotate doesn't always work like you want it to. So with Android 12, Google seems to be making some improvements. The smarter auto-rotate could use front camera of your phone to see the orientation your head is and rotate the display accordingly. This would be especially useful for those who use their phones while lying down."", ' A separate report by 9to5Google suggests Google will add a dedicated one-handed mode for Android 12 and that users will be able to enable one-handed mode with a gesture. This one-handed mode is expected to see downsizing only along the vertical axis, bringing options that are too high up to reach closer. Additionally, users may be able to set a timeout period that will automatically disable one-handed mode.', "" Moving on to Gaming Mode, a separate report by XDA Developers states Android 12 will have a new “GameManager service.” This would likely trigger when a game is started and manage settings like automatic brightness, auto-rotation, Do Not Disturb mode, and more. A new Battery API is being introduced as well, that will allow games to detect the battery level of connected Bluetooth controller. As for the ‘reduce bright colours' feature, it is allegedly meant for the helping people with visual impairments. It may be part of the quick settings in Android 12."", ' Android 12 does not have a release date yet but Google may launch it towards the end of this year.

Vivo had announced a list of its smartphones that were scheduled to get the latest version of Android back in January. The Vivo X50 was scheduled to get the software update at the end of January but did not receive it for unknown reasons. It now seems that Vivo is rolling out the software update for the X50 based on a tweet from the FuntouchOS team."", ' The FuntouchOS India team responded to a Vivo X50 user about the latest update, mentioning that the update is currently under greyscale testing. Based on the tweet, it is safe to assume that the software update is currently rolling out in a staged manner and a few Vivo X50 (Review) users should be able to download it on their devices. This tweet was first spotted by PiunikaWeb. Staged rollouts limit the number of people who get the update. This helps manufacturers iron out bugs and issues quicker before releasing a stable update for all users.', "" Vivo hasn't released a changelog for the Vivo X50 yet but we can expect new Android 11 features to make their way to this device. Some key Android 11 features such as chat bubbles, built-in screen recording, updated power menu, enhanced privacy and security should make their way to the Vivo X50. It would also get a recent Android Security Patch with the update. We can expect Vivo to roll out a stable update for the X50 if this greyscale testing is successful."", ' While Vivo is updating its current lineup of smartphones to Android 11, the company is also expected to launch the new Vivo X60 Series in India soon.

302," iPhone 13 Pro Models With Always-On Display Tipped to Continuously Show Clock, Battery Icons","[' Apple is likely to upgrade to the display it used on the iPhone 12 Pro models', "" iPhone 13 Pro models will feature an always-on display along with the ability to persistently show the clock and battery icons, according to a tipster. The Cupertino company offered always-on display experience on the Apple Watch — with the launch of the Apple Watch Series 5 in 2019. However, that same experience is now rumoured to be extended to the flagship iPhone lineup. The 2021 iPhone models are also said to have an improved MagSafe technology, with stronger magnets over what's introduced on the iPhone 12 models last year."", ' Tipster Max Weinbach via YouTube channel EverythingApplePro has reported the presence of an always-on display on the iPhone 13 Pro models, with persistent clock and battery charging display.', ' “Always-on display will have minimal customisability,” Weinbach said, as quoted by EverythingApplePro. “Current design basically looks like a toned down lockscreen. Clock and battery charge is always visible.”', ' The tipster has also mentioned that notifications on the screen will be displayed using a bar and icons.', "" “Upon receiving, the notification will pop up normally except that the screen will not entirely light up. Instead, it will display it just like you're used to right now except dimmed down and only temporarily,” he explained."", ' Some earlier reports also mentioned an always-on display on the iPhone 13 Pro models. Those are also rumoured to have improved, low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) OLED panels along with higher refresh rates of up to 120Hz.', "" Weinbach has also suggested that the iPhone 13 Pro models would come with a slightly more texturised back over what's there on the current iPhone flagships. It is assumed to be a soft matte finish — something similar to the back of the Google Pixel phones."", ' The tipster has also mentioned, citing a person familiar with the development, that while the chassis of the new iPhone models would remain the same as the iPhone 12 series, there would be stronger MagSafe magnets. This suggests that Apple may have decided to address concerns such as the leather wallet falling off from the MagSafe connector on the iPhone 12 models.', ' The video posted by EverythingApplePro also gives us a glimpse of portless iPhone models. It also mentions that with stronger MagSafe magnets, Apple is likely to bring the portless iPhone to the world this year.', ' Apple is also said to have plans to bring astrophotography to the entire iPhone 13 lineup. It is believed to be a complete automatic mode in which the iPhone would use software algorithms — along with improved camera optics — to register certain artifacts, such as stars or the Moon. It could be similar to the astrophotography debuted on the Pixel 4 in 2019.', ' Weinbach has also corroborated some earlier reports suggesting an improved ultra-wide camera experience on the iPhone 13 lineup. He has suggested that there could be a royal treatment for the ultra-wide camera on the next-generation iPhone models. This means that the new iPhone models are likely to have improved lens and sensor powering the ultra-wide camera.', "" Market analysts including Barclays' Blayne Curtis and Thomas O'Malley also recently suggested the improved ultra-wide-angle camera on the 2021 iPhone lineup. However, Ming-Chi Kuo last year suggested that the new ultra-wide-angle lens would initially be limited to the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max as the rest of the models would get the upgrade in the second half of 2022."", ' In his series of leaks given to EverythingApplePro, Weinbach has also mentioned that the glucose monitoring feature that was speculated to arrive on the Apple Watch Series 7 this year would not happen in time, though it is still in the works. He has also said that the mental health monitoring and warnings on the Apple Watch would also not happen anytime sooner than 2022.', ' Apple has not yet made any confirmations — neither around the iPhone 13 nor the Apple Series 7. It is, thus, safe to consider the rumoured details with some scepticism.

The change has debuted via the iOS 14.5 developer beta. The feature, however, requires an Apple Watch that can quickly unlock the connected iPhone even when the user is wearing a mask. It is unlike the existing scenario in which users are required to either turn their face masks down or enter the passcode to unlock newer iPhone models that have facial recognition support.', ' As reported by 9to5Mac, citing the first iOS 14.5 developer beta, users need to manually enable the Apple Watch unlocking feature on their iPhone by going to Settings > Face ID & Passcode. A toggle available there, called Apple Watch, can be flipped to enable unlocking through an Apple Watch.', "" Once you've enabled the feature, you'll be able to unlock your iPhone via Face ID by simply looking at its screen while wearing an Apple Watch. A haptic feedback notification will arrive on your Apple Watch to inform you about the unlocking. You'll also get the option called Lock iPhone to lock your iPhone directly from the same notification."", ' All this works similar to how Apple currently allows Mac users to unlock their computers when wearing the Apple Watch. The new change will now make things easier for iPhone users.', ' Starting from the iPhone X to the latest iPhone 12 Pro Max, the newer iPhone flagships carry Face ID as a biometric authentication feature that scans for facial features to unlock the device. The technology was well-acclaimed when it was introduced back in November 2017 on the iPhone X; it also made its way to the iPad family through the iPad Pro 3rd Generation in 2018. However, the coronavirus outbreak that has pushed people to wear masks in public places has made it difficult for iPhone users to unlock via Face ID while wearing a face mask.', "" In May last year, Apple tried to ease unlocking iPhone models with Face ID to some extent by releasing faster passcode prompts. That update, however, didn't help much as users still need to swipe up the lock screen and enter their passcode. Some Face ID-compatible custom masks also reached the market but in limited quantities."", "" Users who want to enable the new unlocking feature are required to have an Apple Watch running on watchOS 7.4, which is also currently available under a developer beta release. This means that you won't be able to get the latest experience if you have a dated Apple Watch that isn't compatible with recent watchOS versions. It is also important to note that some features that require Face ID, such as approving an App Store purchase, aren't likely to work with the Apple Watch unlocking for security reasons."", "" Alongside the new unlocking, iOS 14.5 developer beta brings support for Xbox Series S/ X and PlayStation 5 controllers. The update also carries an updated Fitness app and expanded compatibility for the Apple Fitness+ workouts. Further, you'll get fully implemented App Tracking Transparency measures that partially debuted on iOS 14 and are being criticised by Google, Facebook, and other big developers that claim it will hurt small businesses."", ' The iOS 14.5 developer beta also updates Siri with the ability to call emergency services and introduces new interfaces for typing and sending messages using the voice assistant.

421," Budget 2021: Phones May Get Costlier as Exemptions Revoked, Analysts Say It's a 'Short-Term' Issue","[' Photo Credit: Pexels', ' Earlier, government levied no tax on mobile phone PCBA, camera module imports', ' In a bid to promote domestic smartphone manufacturing, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the removal of a few custom duty exemptions on importing parts of mobile chargers and sub-parts of mobile phones. In addition, custom duty on some parts of the handsets are to move from nil rate to a ""moderate 2.5 percent"". With some of these changes coming into effect from February 2, and rest from April 1, we could see hikes in smartphone prices in India, thanks to manufacturers passing the burden onto the customer. Analysts feel that the increase will be a modest one and for a very short term as the ""bulk of these sub-components already have local suppliers."" Presenting the Budget 20201, Sitharaman said, “Domestic manufacturing has grown rapidly, we are now exporting items like mobiles and chargers. For greater domestic value addition, we are withdrawing a few exemptions on parts of chargers, and sub-parts of mobiles. Further, some parts of mobiles will move from ‘nil\' grade to a moderate 2.5 percent.”', "" To be exact, mobile phone parts like the Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA), Camera Module, and Connectors will see a withdrawal of exemption from custom duty and a moderate 2.5 percent tax will be levied, instead of the ‘nil' rate offered earlier. Similarly, parts and sub-parts for manufacturing the battery and the battery pack will see a similar tax rate levied. This new rate is to be levied from April 1 onwards. Rates on import of PCBA and moulded plastic for manufacture of charger or adapter will see an increase from 10 percent to 15 percent. All the other parts required for assembling a mobile charger will see a custom duty levied of about 10 percent. These rates will be applied from February 2."", ' This means that smartphones and mobile chargers could get more expensive in India in the coming months, if the manufacturers choose to pass the burden onto customers. However, switching over to locally manufactured components can help companies mitigate the increased duties. How will it all pan out?', ' Senior Research Analyst at Counterpoint Research, Prachir Singh feels that the shortcomings are less as there are many local suppliers who can help with camera modules, PCBAs, and other parts. “There is a focus on electronics manufacturing and increase in duty for certain sub-components is a push to localise some of these components. This might increase prices for term short term or see a very modest increase as bulk of these sub-components already have local suppliers like for Camera modules, PCBAs, chargers, connectors etc.”', "" Founder and Chief Analyst at techARC Faisal Kawoosa also thinks this is a great move for local suppliers in India. “I think it's an encouraging move as this indicates that government has now faith in the sector that it can now generate resources for the country instead of asking for sobs only.”"", ' Singh is also looking forward to how this push for local manufacturers will replicate on other consumer electronics and manufacturing as well. “Like recent PLI scheme for telecom equipment manufacturing, Consumer IoT, routers and switches, customer premise equipment, next-generation radio access networks and all. There is a big scope to localise value addition in these areas as well.” Just ahead of her announcement about mobiles, Sitharaman at the Budget 2021 address also proposed a review of more than 400 old customs duty exemptions in 2021.

As its name suggests, Mi Air Charge is designed to let users remotely charge their electronic devices including smartphones without any cables, pads, or wireless charging stands. This is unlike existing wireless charging technologies like the ones based on the widely adopted Qi standard in which the power transfers wirelessly using inductive charging over a distance of up to four centimetres. Xiaomi's Mi Air Charge is claimed to charge multiple devices “within a radius of several metres” — and even with physical obstacles. Despite the announcement, the tech will not become generally available in the near future, and remains in a concept phase."", ' To enable the new Mi Air Charge wireless charging experience, Xiaomi has developed an in-house isolated charging pile with a phase control array that consists of 144 antennas transmitting millimetre-wide waves. These waves go directly to the smartphone that requires charging through beamforming. The charging pile also carries five phase interference antennas to understand the location of the smartphone.', "" Xiaomi's Mi Air Charge tech is only being showcased for now, with a Xiaomi spokesperson providing clarity on Twitter by saying that the Mi Air Charge is currently a tech demo and is not coming to any consumer products this year. It is currently unclear whether Xiaomi has applied for any regulatory approvals for the new wireless charging technology. The company has also not provided any details on whether its development has been tested for health risks. We've reached out for more details."", ' As Xiaomi is using a proprietary technology infrastructure, the smartphones that can work with Mi Air Charge will require an antenna array with a built-in beacon antenna and receiving antenna array.', ' “Beacon antenna broadcasts position information with low power consumption. The receiving antenna array composed of 14 antennas converts the millimetre wave signal emitted by the charging pile into electric energy through the rectifier circuit, to turn the sci-fi charging experience into reality,” the company said in a blog post.', ' The initial model of Mi Air Charge technology is said to be capable of delivering 5W remote charging for a single device within a radius of several metres. However, the company claims that multiple devices can also be simultaneously charged with each of them supporting 5W using the same technology. Xiaomi has demonstrated the new technology for smartphones, though it mentioned that it would work with smart watches, bracelets, and other wearables in the near future.', ' “Soon our living room devices, including speakers, desk lamps and other small smart home products, will all be built upon a wireless power supply design, completely free of wires, making our living rooms truly wireless,” the company said.', ' Similar to Xiaomi, Motorola appears to have its proprietary wireless charging technology in the works that could charge smartphones over the distance of up to one\xa0metre. A Lenovo executive posted a video on Weibo to showcase a prototype of the new technology that carries the Motorola One Hyper branding, without revealing any specific details.', "" In April last year, Oppo released a teaser showing an over the air wireless charging concept that it called FreeVOOC.

Apple takes the second spot with a total of 201.1 million shipments in 2020 and a market share of 15 percent. Despite the sanctions and severe component shortages after the escalated US trade ban, Huawei managed to achieve the third spot thanks to its strong performance in China that contributed to around 70 percent of its total shipments.

573, Apple Said to Consider Foldable iPhone; Minor Changes Planned for 2021 Models,"[' Photo Credit: YouTube/ Front Page Tech', ' For its tablet line, Apple is planning a new iPad Pro', "" Apple\xa0has begun early work on an iPhone with a foldable screen, a potential rival to similar devices from Samsung Electronics Co. and others, though it's planning only minor changes for this year's iPhone line."", "" The Cupertino, California-based company has developed prototype foldable screens for internal testing, but hasn't solidified plans to actually launch a foldable iPhone. The development work hasn't expanded beyond a display, meaning Apple doesn't yet have full handset prototypes in its labs, according to a person familiar with the work, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters."", "" Like Samsung's Galaxy Fold, the Motorola Razr reboot and other offerings from Chinese companies including Huawei, a foldable iPhone would let Apple make a device with a larger screen in a more pocketable package. Apple has internally discussed a number of foldable screen sizes, including one that unfolds to a similar size as the 6.7-inch display on the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Current foldable phones have screens that are from 6 and 8 inches unfolded."", ' The foldable Apple screens in testing, like those from Samsung, have a mostly invisible hinge with the electronics stationed behind the display, the person said. Other companies, including Microsoft , have recently launched devices with visible hinges separating two distinct panels. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.', "" This would be a radical departure for Apple. Its pioneering touchable, all-screen smartphone is arguably the most successful consumer technology product in history, helping make Apple the world's most valuable company. However, a foldable iPhone is likely years away or ultimately may never be introduced. The company is currently focused on launching its next-generation flagship iPhones and iPads later this year."", "" Apple isn't planning major changes for this year's iPhone line given the enhancements made to the smartphone in 2020, including 5G and new designs, according to people familiar with the situation. Inside Apple, engineers consider the next iPhones another “S” version of the device, the nomenclature typically given to new iPhones with minor upgrades."", "" The Covid-19 pandemic has also complicated product development, with Apple hardware engineers only working at the company's Silicon Valley offices a few days a week and in limited numbers. That has meant offloading work to Apple's engineers in China."", "" Last year, the pandemic delayed the iPhone 12's release by several weeks, but Apple was able to still include nearly every intended feature except an accessory dubbed “AirTags” for locating physical items like backpacks and keys. The company now plans to launch that accessory this year, and it is planning multiple accessories for it including a leather keychain. Samsung announced a similar gizmo earlier this month."", ' Though overall changes will be minor, Apple is still testing a key upgrade for 2021: an in-screen fingerprint reader. This would add a new method for users to unlock their iPhone, going beyond a passcode and Face ID facial recognition. Apple started to move away from fingerprint sensors in 2017 with the launch of the iPhone X, but Touch ID has remained as a feature on Mac laptops and cheaper iPhones since then. Qualcomm Inc., which provides Apple with 5G modems, earlier this month announced a faster in-screen fingerprint sensor.', "" The feature would be convenient in an environment where users wear masks, which are often incompatible with facial recognition. An in-screen fingerprint reader, which has also been featured on Android phones for several years, could also be quicker than Face ID for some users. Apple won't remove its facial recognition scanner though as it's still useful for augmented reality and camera features."", "" Apple has also discussed removing the charging port for some iPhone models in favor of wireless charging. The company moved to a magnetic MagSafe charging system with the iPhone 12, in addition to removing the charging brick from the iPhone box last year. It's also bringing this \xa0charging technology back to the MacBook Pro."", ' For its tablet line, Apple is planning a new iPad Pro that looks similar to the current model but adds a MiniLED display and much faster processor.

576," Researchers Explain How Locked Android, iOS Phone Encryption Gets Bypassed","[' The new research on Android, iOS phone encryption is conducted by Johns Hopkins University', ' Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have come out with a report that highlights all the vulnerabilities that Android and iOS phone encryption have, and how law enforcement agencies can exploit these to access even locked smartphones. This research comes at a time when governments in various countries are pressuring for backdoors in encryption for accessing data on smartphones when the national security is at stake. However, this new research claims that methods are already available for law enforcement to access locked smartphones of they have the right knowledge and tools, thanks to current security loopholes in the Android and iOS ecosystems.', "" This new research was reported by Wired, and it has been conducted by Maximilian Zinkus, Tushar Jois, and Matthew Green, of Johns Hopkins University. In their analysis, it is found that Apple does have a powerful and compelling set of security and privacy controls, backed by strong encryption. However, critical lack in coverage due to under-utilisation of these tools allows for law enforcement and other hackers to access the phones if they desire. “We observed that a surprising amount of sensitive data maintained by built-in apps is protected using a weak “available after first unlock” (AFU) protection class, which does not evict decryption keys from memory when the phone is locked. The impact is that the vast majority of sensitive user data from Apple's built-in apps can be accessed from a phone that is captured and logically exploited while it is in a powered-on (but locked) state.”"", "" The researchers also spoke about weakness in cloud backup and services as they found ‘several counter-intuitive features of iCloud that increase the vulnerability of this system.' They also highlight the blurred nature of Apple documentation when it comes to “end-to-end encrypted” cloud services in tandem with iCloud backup service."", "" The researchers said that while Android also has strong protections, especially on the latest flagship phones, the fragmented and inconsistent nature of security and privacy controls across devices, makes it more vulnerable. The report also blames the deeply lagging rate of Android updates reaching devices, and various software architectural considerations as big reasons for high breach rate. “Android provides no equivalent of Apple's Complete Protection (CP) encryption class, which evicts decryption keys from memory shortly after the phone is locked. As a consequence, Android decryption keys remain in memory at all times after “first unlock,” and user data is potentially vulnerable to forensic capture,” the researchers detail in their post."", ' Further, it faults de-prioritisation and limited use of end-to-end encryption. Researchers also pointed to the deep integration with Google services, such as Drive, Gmail, and Photos. These apps offer rich user data that can be infiltrated either by knowledgeable criminals or by law enforcement.', "" Johns Hopkins cryptographer Matthew Green told Wired, “It just really shocked me, because I came into this project thinking that these phones are really protecting user data well. Now I've come out of the project thinking almost nothing is protected as much as it could be. So why do we need a backdoor for law enforcement when the protections that these phones actually offer are so bad?”"", ' What will be the most exciting tech launch of 2021?
